# Instructions:

To learn how to use this ... (There is tons of code for much more features... However there is a limit on 933 daily connections and un-american, un-allegiant, criminal local government here in Snohomish County, WA have been obstructing my American Law Studies, National Defense, Constitutional Safeguardings and destroying my Defense Efforts) ... with this said...

When you first fire it up; you are going to need to install all the Python3.11 (or whatever version you are using now)... and install the modules.

In the .py file I give a list of how to install them all (You don't need them all; I was working on the bigger picture and wanted to complete it before releasing any part of it); However this is not the will of my Father in Heaven, Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

If you understand Python 3, you should have no problems picking up where I left off and uncommenting and either recoding or ripping it according to your needs.

It's extremely elementary and amateur as well as my first Python 3 program which I do not feel I am finished with yet. I would eventually like to safeguard the entire Courtlistener.com database for all of Christian America, OUR Constitutional Republic, and the Three WE's, WE THE PEOPLE, WE THE JURY AND WE THE CHURCH!

All datasets are meant to be placed in datasets/ folder. The JSON Bulk Data from Courtlistener.com is comprised of 423 American Constitutionally Bound, Guaranteed and Protected Judicial Jurisdictions.

When Executive Director Mike Lissener of Free Law Project's Courtlistener.com discontinued the JSON Bulk Data for Less Data (Removing URL's for each Opinion) in March 2022 it was comprised of 423 American Constitutionally Bound, Guaranteed and Protected Judicial Jurisdictions.

Since then, Mike Lissener has increased the CSV Datasets to eventually contain Superior Courts across OUR Constitutional American Republic wihch is comprised of 1,276 American Constitutionally Bound, Guaranteed and Protected Judicial Jurisdictions.

Example is with "dataset0" which is inside dataset/

So starting Dragon Breath F.10 Courtlistener EXODUS USC4 DEFENSE R1 - Table01-Table04-A Final Edition...

root@DefendChristianAmerica: # python3.11 dragon_breath_f10_u-gz-USC4-DEFENSE_DEV_Table06_to_Table10_CL_EXODUS_Head_1_R14_REBUILD_Table4-Part-A_R1.py

It will then prompt for dataset name... choose "dataset0" to give it a run! Make sure to import the .SQL file and update the database connector settings to match your MariaDB/MySQL Server.

Create a database and import the file. This can be done by doing "mysql -u USERNAME -p DATABASENAME < database.sql" from Linux Command Line.

To dump it, you simply do: "mysqldump -u USERNAME -p DATABASENAME > databasename.sql"

Edit the following lines to match your local database MariaDB/MySQL server settings:

SQLAlchemy Module:

Line 448 = mysql_username
Line 449 = mysql_username_password
Line 450 = mysql_hostname_ip_address
Line 451 = mysql_port_number
Line 453 = mysql_database_name


mysql.connector Module:

Line 458 = mysql_hostname_ip_address
Line 460 = mysql_database_name
Line 461 = mysql_username
Line 462 = mysql_password


PyMySQL Module:

Line 466 = mysql_hostname_ip_address
Line 468 = mysql_database_name
Line 469 = mysql_username
Line 470 = mysql_password

Once you kick off Dragon Breath F.10 with the settings changed after importing the .SQL File included:

03.03.2023_13.55_DEFENSEDRAGON_DragonBreath_F10_Arrowhead-GroundZero-CL-EXODUS_USC4-DEFENSE-R1.sql

root@DefendChristianAmerica: # python3.11 dragon_breath_f10_u-gz-USC4-DEFENSE_DEV_Table06_to_Table10_CL_EXODUS_Head_1_R14_REBUILD_Table4-Part-A_R1.py

Then type "dataset0" and watch it parse!
