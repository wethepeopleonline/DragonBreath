Slip opinions are the\nwritten opinions that are originally filed by the court.\nA slip opinion is not necessarily the court’s final written decision. Slip opinions\ncan be changed by subsequent court orders. For example, a court may issue an\norder making substantive changes to a slip opinion or publishing for precedential\npurposes a previously “unpublished” opinion. Additionally, nonsubstantive edits\n(for style, grammar, citation, format, punctuation, etc.) are made before the\nopinions that have precedential value are published in the official reports of court\ndecisions: the Washington Reports 2d and the Washington Appellate Reports. An\nopinion in the official reports replaces the slip opinion as the official opinion of\nthe court.\nThe slip opinion that begins on the next page is for a published opinion, and it\nhas since been revised for publication in the printed official reports.

He appeals his convictions\n\n        and sentences on multiple grounds. For the reasons given below, we affirm all of\n\n        his convictions. As further discussed below, a majority of this court also rejects\n\n        Schierman's challenges to his death sentence.\n\n              However, I would hold that two critical, erroneous evidentiary rulings during\n\n        Schierman's penalty phase proceedings require reversal ofthat death sentence. That\n\n        would ordinarily require a remand for a resentencing hearing. I therefore go on to\n\n        conduct our court's statutorily required proportionality review.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        against disproportionate capital sentencing. For the reasons given in this opinion, I\n\n        would reverse Schierman's death sentences and remand for imposition of the only\n\n        statutorily permissible penalty: four consecutive sentences of life in prison without\n\n        the possibility of parole.\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n\n              On the morning of July 17, 2006, officials responded to a fire at the home of\n\n        Leonid and Olga Milkin, a married couple.              When firefighters eventually\n\n        extinguished the flames, they found the bodies of Olga, Olga's sister Lyuba, and\n\n        Leonid and Olga's two young sons, Andrew and Justin. The women's bodies\n\n        appeared to have been undressed or partially undressed at the time of the fire. At\n\n        the time of the fire, Leonid' was stationed overseas. An investigation revealed that\n\n        someone had used accelerants to set the fire, and autopsies revealed that each victim\n\n        had been stabbed to death before the fire began.\n\n               On the morning of the fire, witnesses observed someone who looked like the\n\n        defendant, Conner Schierman, carrying a gas can in front ofthe Milkin home. Police\n\n        contacted Schierman and observed that he had scratches and cuts on his face, head,\n\n        and neck. Schierman told them that he had intervened in a domestic dispute in the\n\n        early morning hours ofJuly 17 and had been hurt in the process. Police subsequently\n\n\n\n              'First names are used when needed for elarity.\n                                                  2\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        discovered a videotape of Schierman filling a gas can at a nearby AMPM on the\n\n        morning of the fire. Eventually, Schierman agreed to come to the police station,\n\n        where he made three taped statements.\n\n              In his third statement, Schierman admitted to being in the Milkin home. He\n\n        said that he woke up on the morning of July 17 covered in blood, lying in an upstairs\n\n        bedroom in the Milkins' home and unable to remember how he had gotten there. He\n\n        stated that he walked around the house, discovered the four bodies, showered and\n\n        changed his clothes, and decided to bum down the house.\n\n              That statement to police was largely consistent with a later statement that\n\n        Schierman made to defense expert Dr. Andrew Saxon. Schierman told Dr. Saxon\n\n        that he started drinlcing in the early evening of July 16, continued drinking all\n\n        evening, and went into an alcoholic blackout some time during that night. He said\n\n        that he woke up bloody on a strange bed some time during the moming of July 17,\n\n        and discovered a woman's body in a pool of blood. But Schierman also told Dr.\n\n        Saxon that he moved the woman's body and continued to drink while he stayed in\n\n        the house.\n\n\n              Eventually,    forensic    investigators   discovered    Schierman's     DNA\n\n        (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the Milkin home. Investigators also found a pair of\n\n        gloves in the home, which a witness identified as belonging to Schierman. When\n\n        Leonid was permitted to retum to his house, he found a fire-damaged knife, which\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        he did not recognize, in the remaining debris. Police discovered that Schierman had\n\n        purchased an identical knife several months earlier. Leonid also discovered a pair\n\n        of men's shoes, recovered from an undamaged section of the basement. Schierman\n\n        had purchased an identical pair the previous November. Finally, police also found\n\n        three empty vodka bottles in a backpack in Schierman's bedroom.\n\n                The State charged Schierman with four counts of aggravated murder in the\n\n        first degree and one count of arson in the first degree. Jury selection began on\n\n        November 13, 2009, and the jury panel was seated two months later, on January 12,\n\n        2010.\n\n\n                The guilt phase ofthe trial lasted another three months. The defense conceded\n\n        that Schierman committed arson, but argued that he panicked and set fire to the house\n\n        to avoid being accused of murders that he did not commit. Schierman was convicted\n\n        as charged. The penalty phase lasted almost one month; the jury voted to impose\n\n        the death penalty.\n\n                The facts relevant to each of Schierman's assignments of error are\n\n        summarized in the appropriate section below.\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n\n\n                                       Guilt Phase Issues\n\n\n              I.    Some of the Trial Court's Juror Eligibility Determinations Violated\n                    Schierman's Right To Presence (under the Sixth and Fourteenth\n                    Amendments and Article I, Sections 3 and 22); Any Error, However,\n                    Was Harmless\n\n              Schierman argues that two separate phases ofjuror selection violated his right\n\n        to presence. The first phase to which he assigns error lasted from late September\n\n        2009 to mid-November 2009. During that time, counsel met with King County's\n\n        jury services manager to review, and sometimes agree to, potential jurors'\n\n        preliminary hardship excusal requests. Schierman was not present during these\n\n        meetings.\n\n              The second phase of juror selection to which Schierman assigns error took\n\n        place on January 12, 2010, the last day of voir dire. During this phase, counsel met\n\n        with the trial judge in chambers, where counsel argued, and the judge ruled on,\n\n        several for-cause juror challenges. Schierman was not present.\n\n              Schierman argues that excluding him from both phases violated his right to\n\n        presence under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n\n        Constitution, and article I, sections 3 and 22 of the Washington State Constitution.\n\n        We conclude that he had no right to presence when his attorneys reviewed juror\n\n        declarations in the nonadversarial setting of the jury administrator's office. We\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        conclude that he did have a right' to presence during the hearing on for-cause\n\n        challenges, but that the error does not require reversal. Because the facts concerning\n\n        these proceedings are relevant to both the presence claim (discussed here) and the\n\n        courtroom closure claim (discussed below), we describe those facts here.\n\n                     A. Facts\n\n\n                        1. Preliminary Excusals for Hardship (Late September to Mid-\n                           November 2009)\n\n              The documents in the record on this appeal show that in late September 2009,\n\n        jury summonses were issued to 3,000 people, directing them to report for service on\n\n        November 13, 2009. A summons recipient could respond by confirming that he or\n\n        she would appear or by submitting a declaration that he or she was unqualified or\n\n        unable to serve. The recipients were told that their responses were made under\n\n        penalty of perjury. Judge Gregory Canova directed the jury services manager for\n\n        King County, Gregory Wheeler, to review declarations of hardship with the\n\n        prosecutor and defense counsel.\n\n              Per King County Superior Court's general policy, potential jurors could get\n\n        hardship excusals for disability, age, a severe financial burden, or prior jury service,\n\n        or because the potential juror was a single parent with young children not attending\n\n        day care. Due to the anticipated length ofSchierman's trial, it was also contemplated\n\n        that jurors might be excused for reasons that normally warrant only a deferral, e.g.,\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        travel plans, employment, or school. Wheeler conducted a preliminary review of\n\n        the potential juror responses and created two stacks of exeusal requests: one for\n\n        \"those that were clearly meant to be excused per court policy\" and one for \"requests\n\n        noting a hardship of a less-than-obvious nature.\" Clerk's Papers(CP)at 21347-48.\n\n        He then met separately with the prosecution and defense regarding both categories\n\n        of hardship request.\n\n              If everyone agreed that a declaration stated a \"hardship\" as defined by official\n\n        court policy. Wheeler excused the potentialjuror without further review by the court.\n\n        If the parties disagreed. Wheeler saved the disputed hardship request so that Judge\n\n        Canova could review it at a hearing. This process went on between October 19 and\n\n        November 6, 2009.\n\n              The particular proceedings from which Schierman claims he was excluded\n\n        were the times when his lawyers, without the State's lawyers,^ went to an\n\n        administrative office in the courthouse to look at either hard copies of or a computer\n\n        screen displaying summoned jurors' e-mailed hardship requests (for reasons not\n\n        clear on this record, the screen could not be downloaded).^ Schierman says that he\n\n\n\n              ^ It appears that the two sets of lawyers met with Wheeler at different times.\n\n              ^ The record does not contain any transcripts concerning the development or\n        execution of this procedure. The documents are silent about these topics. Nor do we have\n        anything to supplement our understanding of how this off-the-record review of paper and\n        electronic documents was developed or carried out, since this is a direct appeal.\n                                                    7\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        was never present at any ofthese early hardship excusal reviews or conferences. The\n\n        State does not dispute that assertion. Schierman was present, however, at all the\n\n        hearings over disputed hardship requests. Thus, there is no claim that Schierman\n\n        was deprived of the right to presence at any court proceeding or at any noncourt\n\n        adversarial proceeding. Instead, Schierman claims only that he was excluded from\n\n        office visits where attorneys looked at a screen or papers for information.\n\n        Appellant's Opening Br. at 17-18(\"The judge made it clear that he would not review\n\n        the individual hardship requests if the parties were in agreement. . . . Schierman\n\n        was never present when the attorneys dealt with these hardship requests.\"(emphasis\n\n        added)).\n\n              Following this preliminary procedure,the venire was sworn,on the record, on\n\n        November 13, 2009. On that day, prospective jurors completed the questionnaire\n\n        \"designed to let [them] tell the court and the lawyers about [themselves] and about\n\n        [their] views on a variety of issues.\" Verbatim Report ofProceedings(VRP)(Nov.\n\n        13, 2009) at 9.\n\n                          2. Far-Cause Challenges in Chambers (January 12, 2010)\n\n              The record tells us quite a bit more about the challenges for cause conducted\n\n        in chambers—with both sets of attorneys, the judge, and the court reporter, but\n\n        without Schierman—^than it tells us about what occurred during the preliminary\n\n        hardship excusal reviews. The facts ofthe in-chambers challenges are as follows.\n\n                                                 8\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              On January 11, 2010, the last day scheduled for voir dire, 70 potential jurors\n\n        remained in the pool. At the end of that day, Schierman challenged six jurors for\n\n        cause: Jurors 25, 44, 58, 76, 104, and 171. The court heard argument from both\n\n        parties on those challenges, but deferred ruling so that the parties could further\n\n        question the six jurors on the following day.\n\n              On the following day, the State questioned Jurors 25 and 58. When that\n\n        questioning was over, Judge Canova stated, in open court, that he would rule \"back\n\n        in[] chambers\" on a number of hardship and for-cause challenges to potential jurors:\n\n                     The next thing is that counsel and I are going to go with the court\n              reporter briefly back into chambers, I'm going to rule on a number of\n              requests for hardship that have been received by the court, I'm also\n              going to rule on a number of challenges for cause that are before the\n              court, that is, requests to excuse jurors for different reasons from\n              counsel. That will take less than ten minutes, and at the conclusion of\n              that I will advise all of you who have been excused, if anyone, and we\n              will then proceed to have counsel exercise their peremptory challenges,\n              that is the selection of the jury will follow.\n\n        VRP(Jan. 12, 2010) at 15-16.\n\n              The minute entry for that same day confirms:\n\n              Defendant and respective counsel present\n\n              Voir dire continues\n\n\n              Court and counsel meet in chambers re hardship and challenges\n\n              Court excuses # 424, 356, 265, 218, 172, 168, 130, 104, 79, 25 (and\n              208 separately)\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

The State opposed a for-cause challenge to\n\n        both jurors. The judge nevertheless dismissed jurors 25 and 58 for cause because\n\n        they indicated that they would hold it against Schierman if he did not testify. The\n\n        defense also challenged jurors 76, 171, 104, and 44 for cause based on statements\n\n        that they would not \"consider alcohol as contributing to mental state or lesser mental\n\n        state.\" VRP(Jan. 12,2010)at 20. Judge Canova denied all four challenges because\n\n        he did not think thejurors' statements indicated an inability to be \"fair and impartial\"\n\n        jurors. Id. at 20-22. He also granted hardship requests to Jurors 49, 79, 130, 172,\n\n        265, 356, and 424. He denied hardship requests to Jurors 104, 168, 218, 267, and\n\n\n\n\n                 A written record was also made.

Kalebaugh, 183 Wn.2d 578, 584, 355\n\n        P.3d 253 (2015)—^the claim fails.\n\n              In support of his argument that the constitutional right to presence attaches to\n\n        preliminary hardship determinations, Schierman relies primarily on this court's\n\n        decision in State v. Irby, which recognized a defendant's right to presence atfar-\n\n        cause eligibility determinations made a/ter jurors submitted written answers to juror\n\n        questionnaires. 170 Wn.2d 874, 884, 246 P.3d 796 (2011). Significantly, Irby\n\n        explicitly distinguished those postquestionnaire determinations from preliminary\n\n        hardship determinations, referring to the latter as \"proceedings that courts have held\n\n        a defendant does not have the right to attend.\" Id. at 882(emphasis added).^ In this\n\n        respect, Irby is consistent with case law from other jurisdictions, which generally\n\n        distinguishes between dismissals that are unrelated to the facts and issues in the\n\n\n\n               ® The facts in Irby obscure this distinction somewhat; substantively, the speeifie\n        dismissals at issue in Irby addressed both hardship (e.g.,\"77 has a business hardship\") and\n        eause (\"36, 48, 49 and 53 had a parent murdered\"), yet this eourt held that they were all\n        part of\"'the work of empanelling the jury.'\" 170 Wn.2d at 878, 883-84 (quoting Gomez\n        V.

But\n        crueially, the Irby majority based that holding on the faet that the e-mail exehange at issue\n        occurred after the venire was swom and the members completed their questionnaires, and\n        on the fact that the e-mail exehange addressed some for-eause dismissals. Id. at 884 (\"In\n        Irby's ease, 'the work of empaneling the jury' began on January 2 . . .[and] was ongoing\n        when the trial judge e-mailed Irby's attorneys and the prosecutor about potentially\n        dismissing 10 jurors, not only for hardship, but because 4jurors had parents who had been\n        murdered.\").\n\n\n\n                                                     13\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

It was\n\n        a preliminary review of documents, after which the lawyers advised the court about\n\n        whether they even wanted a hearing. Thus, with respect to the review ofdeclarations\n\n        regarding preliminary hardship determinations, Schierman's right-to-presence claim\n\n        does not implicate any constitutional interest.^\n\n               Finally, Schierman argues that even if a defendant's right to presence does not\n\n        normally attach to preliminary hardship evaluations, it attached to the hardship\n\n        evaluations here because they were conducted according to a special procedure.\n\n\n\n\n               ^ See, e.g.. City ofMandan v. Baer, 1998 ND 101, 578 N.W.2d 559, 563-64(before\n        the prospective juror reports for service, court may excuse prospective juror for illness or\n        hardship outside the defendant's presence); Porter v.

Martin, 171 Wn.2d 521,532,252 P.3d\n        872 (2011), and the right to self-representation. State v. Rafay, 167 Wn.2d 644, 222 P.3d\n        86(2009). But our case law on the right to presence during jury selection does not address\n        any distinction between the state and federal constitutional right. See In re Pers.

He seems to refer to the fact that Judge Canova\n\n        separately reviewed any disputed hardship requests with the parties. Id. But\n\n        Schierman was present any time the judge conducted such a review. He was absent\n\n        only from his own lawyers' meetings with an administrator to review documents.\n\n                         2. Far-Cause Challenges in Chambers (January 12, 2010)\n\n              Schierman next argues that his right to presence was violated when, in his\n\n        absence, counsel argued and the court ruled on several for-cause juror challenges.\n\n                            a. Preservation of error\n\n              Under Irby, the constitutional right to presence clearly attaches to for-cause\n\n        challenges during voir dire. 170 Wn.2d at 883-84. The State does not dispute this.\n\n              Instead, the State argues that even if an \"error affecting a constitutional right\"\n\n        occurred here, this error was not \"manifest\" within the meaning of that rule. RAP\n\n        2.5(a)(3). We disagree. As noted above, RAP 2.5(a)(3) does not apply in is usual\n\n        fashion in a death penalty case. Lord I, 117 Wn.2d at 849 {citing Jeffries, 105 Wn.2d\n\n        at 418). But even if it did, its prerequisites are satisfied in this instance.^ In order to\n\n        show that an error is \"manifest\" under RAP 2.5(a)(3), Schierman must make \"a\n\n        'plausible showing . . . that the asserted error had practical and identifiable\n\n        consequences in the trial of the case,\"' meaning that '\"given what the trial court\n\n\n               ^ We note that the State did not raise RAP 2.5(a)(3) in our prior case addressing the\n        right to presence at juror eligibility determinations. Consequently, that case does not\n        discuss the rule's application in that context. See Irby, 170 Wn.2d at 885-86.\n                                                    15\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d 91,99-100, 217 P.3d 756(2009)). The\n\n        error in this case meets that standard: the trial judge should have known not to hold\n\n        for-cause challenge arguments in the defendant's absence, and he could easily have\n\n        heard those arguments from the bench instead. Thus,the record is sufficient to allow\n\n        us to determine the merits of Schierman's claim. O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at 99(\"Tfthe\n\n        facts necessary to adjudicate the claimed error are not in the record on appeal, . . .\n\n        the error is not manifest.'\"(quoting State v.

Merits\n\n\n              We conclude that the trial court committed constitutional error in excluding\n\n        Schierman from the discussion and rulings on six for-cause challenges. Irby, 170\n\n        Wn.2d at 884-85 (defendant's absence from a \"portion ofjury selection\" violated\n\n        constitutional right to presence); State v. Slert, 181 Wn.2d 598, 609, 334 P.3d 1088\n\n        (2014)(plurality opinion)(remanding for Court of Appeals to determine whether\n\n        violation of right to presence under Irby was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt),\n\n        rev'd, 186 Wn.2d 869, 383 P.3d466 (2016).\n\n              The State argues that Schierman had no right to presence at the in-chambers\n\n        proceeding because that proceeding \"[did] not require a resolution ofdisputed facts.\"\n\n        Br. ofResp't at 36. It contends that for-cause challenges are strictly'\"legal matters'\"\n                                                  16\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        to which the right to presence does not attach. Id.(quoting Lord II, 123 Wn.2d at\n\n        306).\n\n                We disagree. For-cause challenges are not strictly legal arguments (to which\n\n        a defendant arguably cannot contribute), but involve a factual component. They\n\n        require the court to scrutinize jurors' answers and behavior for indications of bias\n\n        that may be subtle. Federal precedent in other contexts supports this view. E.g.,\n\n        Uttechtv. Brown, 551 U.S. 1, 9-10, 127 S. Ct. 2218, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1014(2007)(in\n\n        determining whether juror can be impartial, the trial court must evaluate juror's\n\n        demeanor; this judgment is entitled to deference). We hold that the trial court erred\n\n        when it heard for-cause challenges outside Schierman's presence.\n\n                            c. Harmless error\n\n\n                In Irby, this court presumed prejudice stemming from the right-to-presence\n\n        violation at issue; accordingly, it placed the burden on the State to show that \"the\n\n        jurors who were excused in [the defendant's] absence . . . had no chance to sit on\n\n        [the]jury.\" 170 Wn.2d at 886. In adopting this test,Irby departed substantially from\n\n        both federal constitutional law and our state precedent on the right to presence. Prior\n\n        to Irby, this court did not place exactly the same burden on the State. E.g., State v.\n\n        Caliguri, 99 Wn.2d 501, 509, 664 P.2d 466 (1983). Instead, before we applied\n\n        constitutional harmless error analysis to a violation of a defendant's right to\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        presence, we required the defendant to \"first raise at least the possibility of\n\n        prejudice.\"\" Id.(emphasis added).\n\n               Schierman contends that we should apply Irby's presumption of prejudice\n\n       (even absent\"at least the possibility of prejudice\")in this case, but the relevant facts\n\n        in Irby are considerably different from the facts at issue here. Irby, 170 Wn.2d at\n\n        886.    In Irby, counsel considered prospective jurors' answers to written\n\n        questionnaires and then, without consulting the defendant, agreed to dismiss several\n\n        jurors without further questioning—some for hardship and some for cause. Id. at\n\n        877-78. Thus, in Irby, the defendant had absolutely no opportunity to \"'give advice\n\n        or suggestion'\" on this portion of the jury selection process. Id. at 883 (quoting\n\n        Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934),\n\n        overruled in part on other grounds by Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489,\n\n        12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964)). Nor did he have any way of determining, after the fact,\n\n        how the excused jurors' \"alleged inability to serve [might have been] . . . tested by\n\n        questioning in [his] presence.\" Id. at 886. In that circumstance, it makes sense to\n\n        burden the State with proving that even absent the constitutional violation, no\n\n        excluded juror could have been seated. To put this another way, it does not make\n\n        sense to burden the defendant with proving the unknowable.\n\n               This case is different. Here, Schierman was present for all of the juror\n\n        questioning—thus, he was present when counsel \"tested\" these jurors' eligibility to\n                                                  18\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

In this respect, Schierman's absence from the in-\n\n        chambers hearing is distinguishable from the facts in Irby and all ofthe authority on\n\n        which that decision relied. Instead, it is more similar to the situation in Slert, where\n\n        such facts militated in favor of finding any error harmless. 186 Wn.2d at 875-76\n\n        (factual differences from Irby compelled a conclusion different from the conclusion\n\n        in Irby).\n\n              Further, Schierman does not specifically allege any prejudice resulting from\n\n        the error here. Nor is any prejudice evident from the record. As noted above, the\n\n        two jurors who were excused after the for-cause challenges (jurors 25 and 58) were\n\n        both excused at the defendant's behest. And of the four jurors whom the defense\n\n        challenged unsuccessfully, only Juror 76 ultimately sat on Schierman's jury.\n\n        Schierman does not explain how defense decisions on peremptory challenges were\n\n        handled. Thus, although we conclude that the trial court erred in hearing for-cause\n\n        challenges outside Schierman's presence, on this record we find the error harmless.\n\n\n                  Id. at 883 (citing Commonwealth v.

We\n\n        explained that hardship determinations—^which decide \"whether a juror is able to\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

And we concluded that\n\n        hardship determinations do not implicate the concerns underlying the public trial\n\n        right, at least where no juror was excused for hardship without further (on-the-\n\n        record) proceedings unless all parties agreed.

Merits\n\n\n               The State argues that the public trial right does not attach to the proceeding at\n\n        issue here—a proceeding that entailed both arguments and rulings on for-cause juror\n\n        challenges. It contends that the public trial right attaches to juror questioning, but\n\n        not to counsel's for-cause challenges or the trial court's rulings thereon. In support\n\n        ofthat argument,the State asserts that the proceeding at issue here was \"functionally\n\n        a sidebar.\" Br. of Resp't at 54-55.\n\n               We reject this argument and reaffirm that the public trial right attaches to juror\n\n        challenges and the rulings thereon.

It\n\n        necessarily follows that the right to a public trial extended to the hearing on for-\n\n        cause challenges in this case.\n\n               As we have explained in numerous recent cases, the public trial right attaches\n\n        to proceedings that have historically occurred in open court and that implicate \"the\n\n        core values\" underlying that right.

The trial court therefore\n\n        erred when it heard and ruled on six for-cause juror challenges in a closed\n\n        proceeding.\n\n              In addition to arguing that the public trial right did not attach to the proceeding\n\n        in question, the State argues in the alternative that any error in closing the for-cause\n\n        challenges was de minimis, \"so insignificant that it does not rise to the level of a\n\n        constitutional violation.\" Br. of Resp't at 57. This kind of error occurs when a\n\n        closure implicates the values underlying the public trial right—^when it involves\n\n        proceedings to which that right attaches—but does not undermine those values to an\n\n        extent that warrants the remedy ofautomatic reversal. Peterson v. Williams, 85 F.3d\n\n        39,43(2d Cir. 1996).\n\n               This argument presents us with a question offirst impression. To be sure, we\n\n        have rejected de minimis arguments in past cases. And one such case.

But we have in fact never\n\n        considered a de minimis error argument as applied to a proceeding like the one at\n\n        issue here: a proceeding that involved no witness testimony, no questioning of\n\n        potential jurors, and no presentation of evidence.

As explained above,\n\n        the proceeding at issue here implicated several of the concerns underlying the right\n\n        to a public trial: public jury selection (including for-cause challenges) contributes to\n\n        oversight of the lawyers and the judge, reminding them of the significance of their\n\n                                                  25\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

But because that\n\n        proceeding involved no juror statements, witness testimony, or presentation of\n\n        evidence, another purpose underlying the public trial right is not implicated:\n\n        '\"diseourag[ing] peijury.\" Morgan, 180 Wn.2d at 325 (quoting Sublett, 176 Wn.2d\n\n        at 72).

Thus, unlike the closures we\n\n        have held to be reversible error in the past, the closure at issue here—although\n\n        error—did not fundamentally taint the process by which the court established the\n\n        facts necessary to assemble the jury or decide the case. Cf. Wise, 176 Wn.2d at 18\n\n        (granting the remedy ofa new trial for the erroneous closure of a portion ofvoir dire\n\n        because \"[hjere, we cannot know what the jurors might have said differently if\n\n        questioned in the courtroom\").\n\n              To properly address this kind of error, we must strike a careful balance.\n\n              On one hand, we must craft a rule that avoids the outcome warned against in\n\n        Justice Stephens's concurrence/dissent: the conflation of specific procedural rights\n\n        with a vague right to fundamentally '\"fair\"' proceedings. Concurrence/dissent at 17\n\n                                                 26\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       (quoting United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 145, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 165\n\n        L. Ed. 2d 409 (2006)). The temptation created by that approach, to excuse\n\n        procedural violations as harmless after the fact, leads predictably to the result that\n\n        procedural rights become entirely unenforceable.             We agree with the\n\n        concurrence/dissent that this outcome poses unacceptable risks to our system of\n\n        justice, and that certain de minimis analyses from other jurisdictions exemplify this\n\n        problem. E.g., Gibbons v. Savage, 555 F.3d 112, 114, 121 (2d Cir. 2009)(holding\n\n        closed proceeding in which potential jurors were questioned about their impartiality\n\n        was de minimis violation); United States v. Al-Smadi, 15 F.3d 153, 154-55(10th Cir.\n\n        1994)(holding that 20-minute closure of trial was de minimis solely because it was\n\n        inadvertent). We stress that our current precedent, which today's decision does not\n\n        disturb, forecloses the possibility of de minimis violations involving juror\n\n        questioning or witness testimony.\n\n              On the other hand, we must also avoid enforcing the public trial right in a\n\n        manner so rigid and mechanistic that we do more harm than good to the values\n\n        underlying that right. The rule contemplated by Shearer's dicta, which purports to\n\n        preclude the possibility of de minimis error under any circumstances, would result\n\n        in that harm, for two reasons. First, a rule requiring automatic reversal for every\n\n        erroneous closure, no matter how inconsequential to the ultimate fairness ofthe trial,\n\n        is more likely to diminish than promote public confidence in the judiciary. This is\n                                                 27\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        no doubt why the United States Supreme Court has held that where the public trial\n\n        right is concerned, \"the remedy should be appropriate to the violation.\" Waller v.\n\n        Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 50, 104 S. Ct. 2210, 81 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1984).^^ Second, a rule\n\n        that completely forecloses the possibility of de minimis violations will often force\n\n        appellate courts to choose between two undesirable outcomes: on one hand, a\n\n        reversal that is a clear windfall for the defendant and waste ofresources for everyone\n\n        else; on the other, a holding that the public trial right does not attach at all to the\n\n        proceeding in question. The policy implications of such a rule are troubling: it\n\n        creates an incentive for appellate courts to find more and more proceedings exempt\n\n        from Sixth Amendment and article I, section 10 protections altogether. This is no\n\n        doubt why there is no jurisdiction we are aware ofthat has adopted a rule completely\n\n        rejecting the doctrine of de minimis closures.\n\n               In light ofthese competing concerns, we hold that the doctrine of de minimis\n\n        error can apply to the proceeding at issue in this case, which involved no juror\n\n\n                 Waller shows that sometimes even structural errors do not warrant the remedy of\n        a new trial. 467 U.S. 39. There, the United States Supreme Court held that the closure of\n        a seven-day preliminary suppression hearing was a constitutional error and that the\n        defendant \"should not be required to prove specific prejudice in order to obtain relief.\" Id.\n        at 49. But it also denied the remedy of a new trial. Instead, the Court remanded for a new\n        suppression hearing and ordered a new trial only if the second,public suppression hearing\n        resulted in the exclusion of evidence admitted in the first trial. Id. at 50. Thus, Waller\n        illustrates the fact that a new trial is not always the remedy for the structural error of\n        courtroom closure. See also Weaver v. Massachusetts, U.S. , 137 S.

We also hold, for the\n\n        reasons given below, that the closure at issue here was a de minimis error and\n\n        therefore does not warrant the remedy of automatic reversal.\n\n              As noted above and elaborated in Justice Yu's concurrence/dissent, the de\n\n        minimis error inquiry asks to what extent the particular closure in question\n\n        undermined the values furthered by the public trial right. Peterson, 85 F.3d at 43.\n\n        While this inquiry is necessarily case specific, courts applying it have considered the\n\n        length of and reason for the closure (e.g., whether it was inadvertent), Brightman,\n\n        155 Wn.2d at 517(collecting cases); the substance ofthe closed proceedings.

While a defendant need not object to a courtroom closure in\n\n        order to preserve the issue for direct appeal, the lack of objection is some indication\n\n        that the trial remained fundamentally fair.

And real-time observation is certainly a better outlet for community\n\n        \"concern, outrage, and hostility,\" Press Enter., 478 U.S. at 13, than review of a cold\n\n        record is.   But in this case, the 10-minute meeting in chambers, which was\n\n        contemporaneously memorialized and publicly announced immediately afterward,\n\n        and occurred without testimony and without objection, cannot be said to have\n\n        meaningfully undermined public confidence or participation in the judicial system.\n\n        Indeed, it is more realistic to say that reversing four convictions for aggravated\n\n        murder resulting from a months-long trial on the basis of a 10-minute in-chambers\n                                                 30\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

We reject Shearer's\n\n        dicta foreclosing the possibility of de minimis violations altogether, and we hold that\n\n        the 10-minute closure at issue here—^to which there was no objection and which\n\n        involved no juror questioning, witness testimony, or presentation of evidence, and\n\n        was simultaneously transcribed and immediately afterward memorialized in open\n\n        court—^was a de minimis violation ofthe right to a public trial.\n\n              III.   The Trial Court Did Not Violate Schierman's Right to Counsel under\n                     the Sixth Amendment or Article I, Section 22 When It Excused\n                     Approximately 100 Jurors for Hardship and Two Jurors for Age-\n                     Related Reasons\n\n              Schierman argues that his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the\n\n        United States Constitution and article I, section 22 of the Washington State\n\n        Constitution was violated when a defense paralegal agreed to the excusal of\n\n        approximately 100 prospective jurors for hardship. He also argues that his right to\n\n        counsel was violated when the jury coordinator excused two jurors for age-related\n\n        reasons.

Hardship excusal ofapproximately 100jurors after consultation\n                           with paralegal\n              On October 19, 2009—^the first day on which Wheeler (the jury services\n\n        coordinator) reviewed hardship requests with counsel—a defense paralegal from\n\n        Connick's office came to the courthouse and met with Wheeler. Wheeler believed\n\n        that the paralegal was an attorney from defense counsel's office, although the\n\n        paralegal did not actually state that she was an attorney. Wheeler told the paralegal\n\n        that the State did not object to granting hardship requests for approximately 100\n\n        individuals. The paralegal agreed that those individuals could be excused on behalf\n\n        of the defense. Wheeler excused the 100.\n\n\n              Approximately 30 minutes later, Conniek found out what his paralegal had\n\n        done and e-mailed the court that there had been a mistake. The e-mail stated that\n\n\n        the defense did not agree to the dismissals. By that time, however, the court had\n\n        already dismissed the 100 jurors.\n\n              On October 20,2009,the trial eourt held an in-chambers eonference to address\n\n        the issue. At the conference, Conniek was, according to the court, \"quite candid in\n\n        acknowledging that it had been his mistake in communicating with his paralegal.\"\n\n        VRP(Oct. 28,2009) at 7.

The e-mail stated that one excused juror was 84 years old\n\n        and the other was 88, and also explained that the excusal \"was done via telephone .\n\n        . . no back-up information.\" Id.(alteration in original).\n\n                     B. Analysis\n\n              A criminal defendant has the constitutional right to counsel at all \"critical\n\n        stages\" of the proceedings. State v. Robinson, 153 Wn.2d 689, 694, 107 P.3d 90\n\n        (2005).\n\n                        1. Hardship excusal ofapproximately 100jurors after consultation\n                             with defense paralegal\n              Schierman argues that preliminary hardship excusal determinations are a\n\n        critical stage of the criminal proceedings. He does not cite any authority; he makes\n\n        only the broad argument that \"[jjury selection is a critical stage.\" Appellant's\n\n        Opening Br. at 36.\n\n               The State argues that the right to counsel cannot attach to a determination that\n\n        may be delegated to court staff. More specifically, it argues that a hardship excusal\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        cannot be a \"critical stage\" of the criminal proceedings because it involves no\n\n        \"judicial decisionmaking.\" Br. of Resp't at 65.\n\n              Schierman is correct that the \"critical stage\" determination does not turn on\n\n        the presence or absence ofjudicial decision-making. E.g., United States v. Wade,\n\n        388 U.S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149(1967)(right to counsel attaches to\n\n        postindictment lineup). However,ifthe right to counsel is claimed for a nonjudicial\n\n        proceeding, that proceeding constitutes a '\"critical stage'\" only if\"the accused [is]\n\n        confronted . . . by the procedural system, or by his expert adversary, or by both.\"\n\n        United States v. Ash, 413 U.S. 300, 311, 93 S. Ct. 2568, 37 L. Ed. 2d 619(1973).\n\n              The necessary corollary of this rule is that if the accused is not in front of a\n\n       judge, not confronted by the procedural system, not confronted by the adversary, and\n\n        not really confronted at all, then the right to counsel does not attach. In this case,\n\n        the trial court established a hardship determination procedure that afforded both\n\n        parties an opportunity to object. One of the steps in that procedure was that the\n\n        lawyers could view juror hardship determinations—some of which came in online\n\n        and some of which came in on paper—in the jury administrators' office. The State\n\n        and the defense did go to that office, but they went separately. They looked at\n\n        declarations there,just as they might look at declarations in the privacy oftheir own\n\n        offices. Then, based on their record review,they informed the administrator and the\n\n       judge about whether a hearing was necessary. Every time a party requested a\n                                                 34\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        hearing, the request was granted. Thus, this is not a situation where the State was\n\n        represented at an adversarial proceeding and the defendant was not.\n\n              Even if it were, the invited error doctrine prohibits a party from appealing on\n\n        the basis of an error that he or she \"set up\" at trial. City ofSeattle v. Patu, 147 Wn.2d\n\n        717, 720, 58 P.3d 273 (2002)(citing State v. Pam, 101 Wn.2d 507, 511, 680 P.2d\n\n        764(1984), overruled on other grounds by State v. Olson, 126 Wn.2d 315,893 P.2d\n\n        629(1995)). In this case, defense counsel both caused the error and failed to request\n\n        any remedy when given the opportunity. Thus,the error was invited and Schierman\n\n        cannot raise it now, on appeal.\n\n                         2. Jury coordinator's excusal oftwojurorsfor age-related reasons\n               Schierman's assignment of error to these dismissals is contradicted by the\n\n        record. The e-mail from Rials to Wheeler identified the two excused jurors by name.\n\n        CP at 24703. On October 22, 2009, defense counsel sent an e-mail to Wheeler\n\n        identifying these same two jurors by name and agreeing to their excusal for\n\n        \"adv.age.\" CP at 25068.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   35\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              IV.     The Trial Court Did Not Err, under This Court's Decisions in\n                      Dearbone^^ and Luvene)'^ by Permitting the State To File a New Notice\n                      of Special Sentencing Proceeding in November 2009\n              RCW 10.95.040(1) provides, \"If a person is charged with aggravated first\n\n        degree murder as defined by RCW 10.95.020, the prosecuting attorney shall file\n\n        written notice of a special sentencing proceeding to determine whether or not the\n\n        death penalty should be imposed when there is reason to believe that there are not\n\n        sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency.\" RCW 10.95.040(2) provides\n\n        that the notice must be filed \"within thirty days after the . . . arraignment.\" In\n\n        Dearbone and Luvene, this court held that RCW 10.95.040(2) requires strict\n\n        compliance.\n\n              Schierman argues that before the State filed the notice of special sentencing\n\n        proceeding in his case, it failed to charge him with aggravated first degree murder\n\n        \"\"as defined by RCW 10.95.020\" because it omitted some ofthe language describing\n\n        the aggravating factor alleged. RCW 10.94.040(1)(emphasis added). He argues\n\n        that the notice of special sentencing proceeding was therefore invalid under\n\n        Dearbone and Luvene.

Facts\n\n              The State charged Schierman on July 24,2006, with four counts ofaggravated\n\n        first degree murder and one count of first degree arson. Count I alleges that\n\n        Schierman premeditatedly caused the death of Olga and \"that further aggravating\n\n        circumstances exist, to-wit: there was more than one victim; Contrary to RCW\n\n        9A.32.030(l)(a) and 10.95.020(10).\" CP at 1. Counts II, III, and IV allege similarly\n\n        that Schierman murdered Lyuba, Justin, and Andrew. They also included the\n\n        following language:\n\n              [The State accuses Schierman] of the crime of Aggravated Murder in\n              the First Degree, a crime of the same or similar character and based on\n              a series of acts connected together with another crime charged herein,\n              which crimes were part ofa common scheme or plan, and which crimes\n              were so closely connected in respect to time, place and occasion that it\n              would be difficult to separate proof of one charge from proof of the\n              other, committed as follows: ....\n\n        Id.

The State explained\n\n        that although the information cited to the correct statute where it alleged the\n\n        existence of aggravating circumstances, it omitted part of the statutory language.\n\n        The information alleged that there was \"more than one victim; Contrary to . . .\n\n       [ROW] 10.95.020(10),\" CP at 1-2, but the full language of RCW 10.95.020(10)\n\n        reads: \"There was more than one victim and the murders were part ofa common\n\n        scheme or plan or the result ofa single act ofthe person\"(Emphasis added.) The\n\n        State moved to amend the information to add the missing language.\n\n              The court heard argument on that motion on November 3, 2009. The State\n\n        admitted its error but argued that the amendment would not prejudice the defense,\n\n        since \"there ha[d] never been . . . any question in this case as to which aggravating\n\n        factor was alleged.\" VRP(Nov. 3, 2009)at 100. The defense objected that it would\n\n        be prejudiced ifthe State were permitted to amend the information. It argued that it\n\n        would have conducted discovery differently had it known that the State would allege\n\n        that the murders were part of a common scheme or plan, the result of a single act of\n\n        the person, or both.\n\n              The court granted the State's motion to amend the information, concluding\n\n        that the defense would not be prejudiced since if the amendment changed the\n                                                 38\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The court's order\n\n        states that the \"Amended information corrects [a] scrivener's error.\" CP at 6764.\n\n        The amended information is identical to the original information except that it\n\n        alleges the full aggravating circumstance listed in RCW 10.95.020(10): \"There was\n\n        more than one victim and the murders were part ofa common scheme or plan or the\n\n        result ofa single act ofthe person.\" CP at 6766-68 (emphasis added).\n\n              The State filed a new death penalty notice on the same day (November 3,\n\n        2009). CP at 6769. The defense filed a motion to strike that notice, arguing that the\n\n        original notice of special proceedings had been based on a faulty charging\n\n        information and that it was now too late to file another notice. The court denied that\n\n        motion, ruling that the original charging information had properly pleaded the\n\n        aggravating circumstance listed at RCW 10.95.020(10).\n\n                     B. Analysis\n              Schierman argues that the original information did not properly charge him\n\n        with aggravated first degree murder, that the original notice of special sentencing\n\n        proceeding was therefore invalid, and that the subsequent notice of special\n\n        sentencing proceeding was therefore untimely. Accordingly, he argues that the State\n\n        never filed a valid notice of special sentencing proceeding and that it therefore may\n\n        not seek the death penalty. He relies on Dearbone and Luvene.\n\n\n\n                                                 39\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n               We disagree. Schierman does not point to any defect in the content or timing\n\n        ofthe original notice ofspecial sentencing proceeding. He identifies instead a defect\n\n        in the information, i.e., that it failed to specifically allege that the murders were \"part\n\n        of a common scheme or plan or the result of a single act ofthe person.\" CP at 6764-\n\n        68. That is not a defect in the death notice. And,in fact, the information did contain\n\n        the \"common scheme or plan\" language—just not in the usual place. Its failure to\n\n        include the \"single act of the person\" language is not a defect in the content, filing,\n\n        or service ofthe death notice. ROW 10.95.020(10). We therefore reject Schierman's\n\n        argument that the notice of special sentencing proceeding was invalid.\n\n               V.     The Trial Court Misunderstood the Standard Applicable to the\n                      Defense's For-Cause Juror Challenges, But It Did Not Violate\n                      Schierman's Rights to Due Process and an Impartial Jury (under the\n                      Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments)\n               The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\n\n        guarantee a criminal defendant the right to trial by an impartial jury.

The trial court and defense counsel then debated\n\n        the standard applicable to \"disqualification of a juror for cause because of their\n\n        favoring the death penalty.\" VRP (Dec. 1, 2009) at 56.\n\n              The trial court opined that under Morgan, a juror could not be disqualified on\n\n        the basis of his or her support for the death penalty unless \"the person really has an\n\n        automatic reaction . . . [and] will impose the death penalty if [the defendant] is\n\n        convicted of a particular crime regardless of any . . . mitigating circumstances.\" Id.\n\n        The court also opined that a different standard applied to jurors who opposed the\n\n        death penalty. It rejected defense counsel's for-cause challenge because it concluded\n\n        that Juror 25's questionnaire responses indicated that he would consider mitigating\n\n        circumstances \"if we reach a sentencing phase.\" Id. at 60.\n\n              Defense counsel objected, arguing that Juror 25's responses indicated that he\n\n        would consider mitigating circumstances only \"insofar as [they] relate[] to the\n\n        offense itself.\" Id. at 61. Defense counsel also objected to the court's interpretation\n                                                  41\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The following day, defense counsel filed a written motion arguing that\n\n        the correct standard for disqualifying a juror because of his or her views on the death\n\n        penalty was '\"whether the juror's views would 'prevent or substantially impair the\n\n        performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his\n\n        oath.\"\" CP at 6972(boldface omitted)(quoting Morgan, 504 U.S. at 728 (quoting\n\n        Wainwright v.

In this motion, the defense\n\n        asked the court to disqualify for cause Jurors 14, 20, and 25.\n\n              In response, the State filed a motion arguing that different standards apply to\n\n        jurors who oppose and jurors who favor the death penalty. According to the State,\n\n        jurors who oppose the death penalty may be excluded on that basis whenever their\n\n        opposition would \"substantially impair them from performing their duties,\" but\n\n        jurors vjhofavor the death penalty may be excluded on that basis only when they\n\n        \"would automatically impose the death penalty.\" CP at 6977.\n\n               On December 8, 2009, the trial court issued a lengthy oral ruling on the\n\n        parties' motions and the meaning ofthe Morgan decision. It concluded that its prior\n\n        rulings were correct, and that United States Supreme Court precedent applicable in\n\n        this state under Brown, 132 Wn.2d at 598, established different standards for\n\n        disqualifying pro-death-penalty and anti-death-penalty jurors.

The trial court rejected the challenge\n\n\n\n\n                                                  43\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The court specifically noted that Juror 59 admitted he\n\n        knew little about the law and said that he would follow the court's instructions. Id.\n\n        at 108. It also concluded that Juror 59 \"was fine with the presumption of life being\n\n        the presumed sentence in the penalty phase . . . and . . . would follow that\n\n        presumption.\" Id. at 108-09. Ultimately, Juror 59 was dismissed before the jury\n\n        began its deliberations.\n\n                          2.

The trial court rejected the challenge because\n\n        it concluded that Juror 140 had, on further questioning by counsel for both parties,\n\n        shown herself to be capable of applying the law as instructed by the court.\n\n                 Juror 140's responses to counsel's in-person questions were somewhat\n\n        ambiguous. In response to questions by defense counsel. Juror 140 stated that she\n\n\n\n                 As indicated by my analysis below,there is no such thing as a \"Morgan standard\"\n        for excluding jurors in a capital case.

She also agreed that if a defendant\n\n        were convicted of premeditated murder, \"then . . . the death penalty is the only\n\n        appropriate penalty for a guilty murderer like that.\" Id. at 32-33. In response to\n\n        questions by the State, however. Juror 140 stated that even if a defendant were\n\n        convicted of premeditated murder,\"he might not need death, you know,there might\n\n        be hope ... for this person.\" Id. at 37. She also agreed that she was \"okay with the\n\n        ... idea ...[tjhat [a defendant convicted of aggravated premeditated murder] could\n\n        spend the rest of[his] days in prison,\" instead offacing execution, because she didn't\n\n       \"know the whole story yet\" and stated that she \"can't go with what my heart tells\n\n        me,I've got to listen to the facts ofthe whole thing and be open.\" Id. at 38-40. She\n\n        repeatedly emphasized the possibility that a person who committed premeditated\n\n        murder might be truly sorry and \"better himself.\" Id. at 38. She stated that she was\n\n        \"open to the idea\" that \"fairness or mercy\" could play a role in sentencing \"because\n\n        we don't know the whole story yet.\" Id. at 39.

Juror 280\n\n              In response to questioning by the court, Juror 280 stated that she would\n\n        probably have difficulty imposing the death penalty because \"the death penalty is\n\n        definitely finite, and there's no going back. I also think that it's kind of arbitrary,\n\n        from kind of state to state, and perhaps maybe if you have more money you might\n\n        get a better judgment.\" VRP (Dec. 21, 2009) at 22. She clarified that she could\n\n        impose the death penalty under \"really clearcut. . . circumstances where ... if the\n\n        person was let out they would kill again.\" Id. In response to questioning by defense\n\n        counsel. Juror 280 indicated that she might have trouble following the court's\n\n        instructions during the penalty phase because her personal \"bar [to imposing the\n\n        death penalty] may be different than what the court instructs.\" Id. at 29. She then\n\n        repeated that her \"bar\" was that the death penalty should be imposed only on a\n\n        \"person . . . likely to kill again.\" Id. at 30.\n\n               The trial court granted the State's for-cause challenge to Juror 280, finding\n\n        that her approach to the death penalty would add to the State's burden ofproof:\"She\n\n        has [her ability to impose the death penalty] narrowed down to one very, very limited\n\n        set of facts and that set of facts clearly, in the court's view, would substantially\n\n        impair her ability to follow the court's instructions as to the law to be applied in this\n\n        case.\" Id. at 39.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    46\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Analysis\n              In the death-qualification context, the State, as well as the defendant, is\n\n        entitled to an \"impartial jury.\" State v. Hughes, 106 Wn.2d 176, 185-86, 721 P.2d\n\n        902(1986)('\"The guarantee of impartiality cannot mean that the state has a right to\n\n        present its case to the jury most likely to return a verdict of guilt, nor can it mean\n\n        that the accused has a right to present his case to the jury most likely to acquit. But\n\n        the converse is also true. The guarantee cannot mean that the state must present its\n\n        case to the jury least likely to convict or impose the death penalty, nor that the\n\n        defense must present its case to the jury least likely to find him innocent or vote for\n\n        life imprisonment.'\"(quoting Smith v.

Brown, 132 Wn.2d at 598.\n\n              For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court erred when it ruled\n\n        that different disqualification standards apply to jurors who oppose, and jurors who\n\n        favor, the death penalty.

See Morgan, 504 U.S. at 728-29; Ross v. Oklahoma,\n\n        487 U.S. 81, 85, 108 S. Ct. 2273, 101 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1988). There is no separate,\n\n        stricter requirement that protects \"death-prone jurors\" from dismissal unless they\n\n        admit that they would \"automatically\" vote for the death penalty. Witt, 469 U.S. at\n\n        418 n.2.\n\n\n              Morgan did not change that. Rather, it reaffirmed and elaborated the Court's\n\n        earlier holding, in Ross, that a juror is per se ineligible under the Witt standard if he\n\n\n\n                                                  48\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

Indeed,\n              because such a juror has already formed an opinion on the merits, the\n              presence or absence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances\n              is entirely irrelevant to such a juror. Therefore, based on the\n              requirement of impartiality embodied in the Due Process Clause of the\n              Fourteenth Amendment, a capital defendant may challenge for cause\n              any prospective juror who maintains such views. Ifeven one such juror\n              is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed, the State is disentitled\n              to execute the sentence.\n\n\n        Morgan, 504 U.S. at 729(emphasis added).\n\n              Indeed, the standard for juror exclusion was not even at issue in Morgan—^the\n\n        case concerned only the defendant's entitlement to ask certain questions during voir\n\n        dire. The Morgan Court rejected the argument that \"general fairness and 'follow the\n\n        law' questions ... are enough to detect those in the venire who automatically would\n\n        vote for the death penalty,\" reasoning that a juror might sincerely believe that his or\n\n        her \"dogmatic views\" are fair, impartial, and consistent with the law.

Ct. 1770, 20 L.\n              Ed. 2d 776](1968),... then it is difficult to understand why petitioner would\n              not be entitled to challenge, not just those jurors who will \"automatically\"\n              impose the death penalty, but also those whose sentiments on the subject are\n              sufficiently strong that their faithful service as jurors will be \"substantially\n              impaired\"—the reformulated standard we adopted in ... Witt, 469 U. S. 412.\n              . . . The Court's failure to carry its premise to its logical conclusion suggests\n               its awareness that the premise is wrong.\n\n        Morgan, 504 U.S. at 750 n.5 (Scalia, J., dissenting)(emphasis omitted).\n\n               When the trial court endorsed this portion of the dissent, it noted that the Morgan\n        majority \"[did] not respond at all to this simply stated analysis.\" VRP (Dec. 8, 2009) at\n        226. We disagree. The Morgan majority opinion makes very clear that the same\n        (substantial impairment) standard applies to jurors opposed to and in favor of the death\n        penalty. See, e.g., Morgan, 504 U.S. at 734-35 (Witherspoon . . . would be in large\n        measure superfluous were this Court convinced that... general ['follow the law'] inquiries\n        could detect those jurors with views preventing or substantially impairing their duties in\n        accordance with their instructions and oath. But such jurors—^whether they be unalterably\n        in favor of, or opposed to, the death penalty in every ease—by definition are ones who\n        cannot perform their duties in accordance with law, their protestations to the contrary\n        notwithstanding.\"). Morgan presented only one issue: whether a trial court may prevent\n        defense counsel from asking potential jurors if they would \"automatically\" impose the\n        death penalty upon conviction. Id. at 721. The Court had no occasion to consider what\n        other inquiries—also designed to identify \"substantial impairment\"—a defendant might be\n        constitutionally entitled to make.\n\n               It should also be noted that the State's brief contains a misstatement relating to this\n        issue. The State asserts that the Witt Court explicitly limited its holding to for-eause\n        challenges by the prosecution: \"In fact, in the footnote appended to its 'prevent or\n        substantially impair' sentence in Witt, the Court wrote:'\n                                                                [W]e simply modify the test stated\n        in Witherspoon's footnote 21 to hold that the State may exclude from capital sentencing\n        juries that \"class\" of veniremen whose views would prevent or substantially impair the\n\n                                                     51\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n                         2. The trial court's error did not deprive Schierman ofhis state and\n                           federal constitutional right to an impartialjury; thus, he is not\n                             entitled to relief\n\n                             a. Juror 59: even if the trial court erred by refusing to dismiss\n                                Juror 59, this error does not entitle Schierman to relief\n                                because Juror 59 was excluded before deliberations began\n               Schierman acknowledges that Juror 59 was excused before closing arguments,\n\n        but argues that the mere fact of his seating \"demonstrates how prejudicial the court's\n\n        misreading ofthe law was to [the defense].\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 55.\n\n               Where a trial court erroneously denies a defendant's for-cause challenge and\n\n        the defendant is forced to use a peremptory challenge to cure the trial court's error,\n\n        his rights are not violated so long as he is subsequently convicted by ajury on which\n\n        no biased juror sat. United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 307, 120 S.\n\n        Ct. 11A, 145 L. Ed. 2d 792(2000); State v. Fire, 145 Wn.2d 152, 154, 34 P.3d 1218\n\n        (2001). Juror 59 was not excluded through peremptory challenge, but he was\n\n        excluded before Schierman's jury began deliberations. Under the reasoning of\n\n        Martinez-Salazar and Fire, a trial court's erroneous denial of a for-cause challenge\n\n\n\n        performance of their duties in accordance with the instructions or their oaths.'\" Br. of\n        Resp't at 88 (alteration in original)(quoting Witt, 469 U.S. at 424 n.5). Read in context,\n        however, the reference to \"the State\" in the Witt footnote clearly indicates trial courts and\n        state legislatures—it is not a reference to the prosecution. Witherspoon, the subject ofthe\n        footnote in Witt, addressed a state statute that made any person with '\"conscientious\n        scruples against capital pruhshment'\" subject to for-cause removal from a capitaljury pool.\n        391 U.S. at 512(quoting former III. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, § 743 (1959)).\n\n                                                    52\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        is not independent grounds for relief. Fire, 145 Wn.2d at 165 (citing Martinez-\n        Salazar, 528 U.S. 324). Rather,the defendant is entitled to relief only when the trial\n\n        court's error actually resulted in the seating of a biased juror. Id.\n\n              The trial court's refusal to dismiss Juror 59 for cause did not result in Juror 59\n\n        actually deliberating in Schierman's case. Nor does Schierman allege that the\n        refusal indirectly resulted in the seating of any biased juror. Rather, he asserts that\n\n        it illustrates the prejudicial nature of the trial court's views on for-cause dismissals.\n\n        This argument asks us to assume that prejudice resulted from the court's application\n\n        of an asymmetric juror-exclusion standard. Under Fire, we cannot make that\n\n        presumption. Id. Thus, even if the trial court erred in seating Juror 59, this error\n\n        does not entitle Schierman to relief.\n\n                            b. Juror 140: the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n                                refusing to dismiss Juror 140 for bias\n               Unlike Juror 59, Juror 140 did deliberate in Schierman's case. But the record\n\n        does not indicate that Juror 140's seating resulted from the trial court's legal error.\n\n        Although the trial court erred in ruling that different standards apply to defense and\n\n        prosecution for-cause challenges in a capital case, it explicitly stated that Juror 140\n\n        could be seated under either standard. Thus, it concluded that Juror 140's views on\n\n        capital punishment would not '\"prevent or substantially impair the performance of\n\n        [her] duties as a juror.'\" Witt, 469 U.S. at 424.\n\n\n                                                   53\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              That conclusion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Cross, 156\n\n        Wn.2d 580, 595, 132 P.3d 80(2006). Juror 140 stated that she would not be able to\n\n        decide whether death was the appropriate penalty until she heard all the facts. She\n\n        stated that she would be able to consider mitigating circumstances and apply the\n\n        presumption in favor of life without parole. The trial court did not abuse its\n\n        discretion in concluding that Juror 140 was not substantially impaired in her ability\n\n        to follow the court's instructions and apply the law.\n\n                            c. Juror 280: the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it\n                               dismissed Juror 280 for bias\n\n              Juror 280 explicitly stated that her views on the death penalty would probably\n\n        prevent her from following the court's instructions. In context, this meant that she\n\n        would not consider imposing the death penalty unless the State proved that\n\n        Schierman would kill again if released.\n\n              In Cross,this court affirmed the trial court's exclusion of a juror who said that\n\n        he '\"would have a hard time'\" voting to impose the death penalty because the\n\n        defendant had paraplegia and used a wheelchair. This court reasoned that the\n\n       \"challenge raise[d] a difficult question because ... Cross was entitled to ask the jury\n\n        to grant him mercy on the grounds of his physical state.\" Id. at 596-97. But it\n\n        concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the juror;\"The\n\n        trial judge clearly concluded that Juror 8 was not meaningfully willing or able to\n\n\n                                                  54\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        consider the death penalty given the specific evidence in the case. It was not an\n\n        abuse of discretion to exclude this juror.\" Id. at 597.\n\n              In light ofthis holding in Cross, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse\n\n        its discretion by excluding Juror 280. In this case, Juror 280 told the trial court that\n\n        she would probably not consider voting to execute Schierman unless the State\n\n        proved that he would likely kill again. In Cross, Juror 8 told that court that he would\n\n        probably not vote to impose the death penalty because the defendant had a disability.\n\n        Given the deferential standard ofreview applicable and the concept of\"impartiality\"\n\n        this court adopted in Hughes, 106 Wn.2d at 185-86, we cannot conclude that the trial\n\n        court committed reversible error by excluding Juror 280.\n\n               VI.   Cumulative Error in Jury Summoning and Selection Did Not Violate\n                     Schierman's Right to a Fair and Impartial Jury\n              The errors that occurred during jury selection do not individually warrant\n\n        reversal. In this case, they do not rise to the level of cumulative error in the overall\n\n        jury selection process.\n\n               VII. The Trial Court Did Not Violate Due Process Protections by Permitting\n                     the State To Argue That There Was Circumstantial Evidence of Sexual\n                     Motivation\n\n               Schierman argues that the trial court violated due process protections by\n\n        permitting the State to argue that there was circumstantial evidence of a sexual\n\n        motivation for the murders. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                                  55\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n                     A. Facts\n\n              On December 30, 2009, the State served the defense with a \"Supplemental\n\n        Memorandum And Materials In Support Of Admission Of Crime Scene And\n\n        Autopsy Photographs That Include Images Of The Victims.\" CP at 7200 (italics\n\n        omitted). The memorandum contained a list of photographs and corresponding\n\n        expert witness \"Declaration[s]\" interpreting the images therein. CP at 7231.\n\n        According to the defense, some ofthe interpretations suggested the State's intent to\n\n        \"assert[] some type of sexual motivation.\" CP at 7201-02. Of particular concern\n\n        was medical examiner Dr. Richard Harruffs description of photograph 2548, which\n\n        read as follows: \"Shows the victims' legs are spread apart, in all likelihood not a\n\n        result of the fire but probably reflects positioning prior to the fire; this photo also\n\n        shows a flashlight in the debris.\" CP at 7232. The defense believed this description\n\n        contradicted statements Dr. Harruff made in a 2007 defense interview to the effect\n\n        that he found nothing unusual about the posing of the victims' bodies and attributed\n\n        their positioning to the \"thermal effect\" of the house fire. CP at 7203-04 (boldface\n\n        omitted). It also argued that any attempt by the prosecution to present a sexual\n\n        motivation theory directly conflicted with the State's earlier stipulation that \"there\n\n        is no physical evidence of sexual assault of any of [the] victims.\" CP at 7202\n\n        (underline omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                  56\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n               The defense moved the court to sanction the prosecution, strike the jury pool,\n\n        and continue the trial, arguing that it needed time to respond to what it deemed a\n\n        completely new theory by the prosecution.^' The trial court set arguments on the\n\n        issue for January 19, 2010, one week after jury selection was scheduled to begin.\n\n        When defense counsel argued that the motions should be decided before jury\n\n        selection began, the trial court ordered that \"there will be no evidence presented of\n\n        sexual motivation or sexual assault, consistent with this Court's prior rulings and the\n\n        prior representations of counsel for the State that that was not an issue in the case.\"\n\n        VRP (Jan. 11, 2010) at 7. The court then stated that it would await the State's\n\n        briefing and the defense reply before addressing the matter further.\n\n               When the State filed its motion in response, it asserted that it had never agreed\n\n        not to pursue a sexual motivation theory. Instead, it said it had agreed only that\n\n        \"there is no phvsical evidence of sexual assault.\" CP at 7347(boldface omitted). It\n\n        also argued that the defense had known \"for literally years\" about the circumstantial\n\n        evidence of a sexual motive, and that there was no legitimate reason for defense\n\n\n\n                  CP at 7201 (\"As a result of the [State's] non-diselosure .. . the defense is foreed\n        to proeeed to trial unprepared.\"), 7209 (\"the jury pool has not been death qualified with\n        respect to [a sexual motivation] aggravator\"); VRP (Jan. 11, 2010) at 3-4 (\"the [jury]\n        selection process is .. . constitutionally defective . . . particularly given the late disclosure\n        of discovery that we received from the prosecutor on December the 30th ...[that] changes\n        the whole picture .... No one has been asked about anything related to the subject matter\n        contained within this new discovery. The entire process is flawed.\"). The State opposed\n        the motion.\n\n                                                      57\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No, 84614-6\n\n\n        counsel to suddenly express concern over the State's intent to pursue this line of\n\n        argumentation. The State cited\n\n              the defendant's sexual comments,on the night ofthe murder, about one\n              of the women across the street; the defendant's sexual banter in his\n              email communications late into the night ofJuly 16,2006;the condition\n              of Olga's body, which was found naked, on her back and with her legs\n              spread; the condition of [Lyuba]'s body, which was found virtually\n              naked, with the one article of remaining clothing, her tank top, pushed\n              above her breasts; and the presence of a probable fire trailer consisting\n              of women's underwear in Alia Botvina's^^ bedroom in the basement.\n\n        CP at 7348 (footnotes omitted).\n\n              The trial court denied the defense motion for sanctions, for a continuance, and\n\n        to strike the jury pool. It rejected defense counsel's argument that voir dire would\n\n        have been conducted differently if the defense had known about the sexual\n\n        motivation theory. The trial court instead agreed with the State that the defense had\n\n        received ample notice that there was \"circumstantial evidence of a sexual motive.\"\n\n        VRP (Jan. 19, 2010) at 147. This evidence was, according to the trial court, crime\n\n        scene photos showing that Olga's and Botvina's bodies had been found nude or\n\n        mostly nude, the presence at the crime scene of a \"probable fire trailer consisting of\n\n        women's underwear,\" and allegations that the defendant made sexual comments\n\n        about one of the victims. Id. at 148-49. The trial court also ruled that the State had\n\n\n\n\n                Alia Botvina is Lyuba's sister who lived in the Milkin's basement; she was not at\n        home at the time the murders took plaee.\n                                                   58\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        not offered, and would not be allowed to present, any expert testimony regarding\n\n       such a motive. Finally, the trial court ruled that the defense could re-interview Dr.\n\n        Harruff on the contradiction between his initial statements and subsequent\n\n        declaration regarding the positioning of the victims' bodies.\n\n                     B. Analysis\n              The State argues that it never misled the defense regarding its intent to argue\n\n        sexual motivation, and that it stipulated that there was no evidence of sexual assault\n\n        only to prevent the defense from independently testing vaginal swabs taken from the\n\n        adult victims. The record supports that contention. CP at 4448-56 (\"State's\n\n        Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Independently Test Extracts\n\n        from Vaginal Swabs(Y-STR Testing)\").\n\n              Further, with the exception of Dr. Harruffs statement regarding the\n\n        positioning of the victims' legs, Schierman does not allege that the State withheld\n\n        any sexual-motivation-related evidence. The trial court permitted the defense to re-\n\n        interview Dr. Harruff about his statement prior to trial, and Dr. Harruff ultimately\n\n        offered no testimony that the victims' legs were positioned apart.\n\n              As for the trial court's statement that the prosecution would not be allowed to\n\n        argue a sexual motivation theory, we agree with the State that this was a \"passing\n\n        comment.. . based on a misunderstanding—later corrected.\" Br. of Resp't at 125.\n\n        As the trial court explained when it ruled on this issue, the State never requested any\n\n                                                  59\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

In that\n\n       respect, IhQ fact of sexual motivation was not at issue in the case, but this did not\n\n        mean that the State agreed not to argue any sexual motivation theory. Schierman\n\n        argues now that he \"reasonably understood the prosecutor's stipulation [regarding\n\n        sexual assault] to mean that sexual motivation would not be an issue at trial.\"\n\n        Appellant's Reply Br. at 36(emphasis added). But that is not a reasonable response\n\n        to the State's stipulation regarding sexual assault.\n\n              VIII. The Evidence Was Sufficient To Support the State's Sexual Motivation\n                     Argument\n\n              Schierman argues that by presenting its sexual motivation theory, the State\n\n        made prejudicial statements unsupported by the evidence. We disagree; the State's\n\n        sexual motivation theory was supported by sufficient circumstantial evidence.\n\n                     A. Facts\n\n\n              Sean Winter, a man who shared a duplex with Schierman and another tenant,\n\n        Isaac Way, at the time of the murders, testified that Schierman engaged in sexual\n\n        conversation on various occasions. He stated that when Schierman moved into the\n\n        house, he asked if there were \"any good-looking women\" in the neighborhood and\n\n        then specifically asked about \"the blonde across the street.\" VRP (Feb. 9, 2010) at\n\n        85. Winter also said that Schierman engaged in \"locker room talk . . . about girls\"\n\n        on the night before the murders, and made a sexual comment in a Russian accent,\n\n                                                  60\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Winter testified that on the night before the\n\n        murders, Schierman had a pornographic video and made ajoke about giving a friend\n\n        a \"blowup doll.\" VRP (Feb. 10, 2010) at 52-54, 66.\n\n              Todd Taylor, a computer forensic technician, testified that Schierman had a\n\n        Myspace chat with someone on the night before the murders, in which he sent and\n\n        received messages of a sexual nature.\n\n              Several witnesses also testified that women's undergarments were found\n\n        strewn around a basement bedroom in the Milkin home. There was evidence of\n\n        forced entry through the back basement door of the home. Dr. Harruff, the medical\n\n        examiner, testified that Olga's and Lyuba's bodies had been found nude or mostly\n\n        nude, and Kim Duddy, a forensic scientist, testified that Lyuba's clothing had been\n\n        removed after she was killed. That clothing was found stuffed into a microwave\n\n        oven vent. Finally, there was evidence that Schierman had an injury on his neck that\n\n        resembled a ligature mark, and testimony that a necklace identified as Schierman's\n\n        had Olga's DNA on it. The forensic expert who testified about the DNA explained\n\n        that he expected to find Schierman's DNA on the whole necklace, but any \"foreign\n\n        biology . . . only on a portion of the necklace,\" and that his test results bore these\n\n        expectations out. VRP (Feb. 17, 2010) at 29-30, 41-42. He also explained that\n\n        foreign DNA could occur on a portion of the necklace \"ifthe necklace was grabbed\n\n        in some way.\" Id. at 29.\n\n                                                 61\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              In the guilt phase closing argument, the prosecutor suggested that Schierman\n\n        had destroyed evidence of a sexual nature: \"Why pour gasoline on the victims'\n\n        bodies? What does he know about those bodies that he doesn't want discovered?\"\n\n        VRP(Apr. 8,2010)at 75. The prosecutor also referenced most ofthe evidence noted\n\n        above:\n\n\n              Well, we know what was going on Sunday evening. I talked about the\n              comment he knew about the women across the street, he knew about\n              the locker room talk, the joke about the blow-up doll, the defendant\n              bringing out the pornographic movie, Jenna Jamison movie,the e-mail\n              at 9:37 at night, 10:00, a sex party, there's nothing wrong with that,\n              people talk, that's not a condemnation, but taken together, what does it\n              tell us?\n\n\n                     We know what's on the floor of Alla's bedroom, we know where\n              the bodies were found and how they were found inside that room at the\n              top of the stairs. Olga completely naked, leaving Lyuba only with her\n              tank-top on.\n\n                     We know what the evidence tells us. We know there was trace\n              evidence found on the pajamas that were taken from the microwave,\n              Lyuba's DNA and the defendant's DNA,and there was trace evidence\n              recovered from underneath Lyuba's body.\n\n        Id. at 77-78. In addition, the prosecutor also suggested that the location of the\n\n        ligature mark—high on Schierman's neck—indicated that Schierman \"may have\n\n        been prone on top ofsomebody else, and who might that person have been? Whose\n\n        DNA is on this necklace? Conner Schierman and Olga Milkin.\" Id. at 78-79.\n\n\n\n\n                                                62\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Finally, in the penalty phase, the prosecutor elicited testimony from\n\n        Schierman's friend Christopher O'Brien that Schierman had referred to the \"hot\n\n        chick\" across the street. VRP (Apr. 21, 2010) at 84.\n\n                     B. Analysis\n              Schierman is correct that counsel, in closing argument to the jury, may not\n\n        make prejudicial statements that are unsupported by the evidence. State v. Rose,62\n\n        Wn.2d 309,312,382 P.2d 513(1963). But counsel may argue \"'the facts in evidence\n\n        and reasonable inferences'\" therefrom. State v. Dhaliwal, 150 Wn.2d 559, 577, 79\n\n        P.3d 432 (2003) (quoting State v. Smith, 104 Wn.2d 497, 510, 707 P.2d 1306\n\n       (1985)). Here, almost every statement that Schierman challenges is a direct\n\n        reference to testimony elicited in the trial.\n\n              The authority on which Schierman relies holds only that counsel may not\n\n        argue a theory for which there is no evidence. Rose, 62 Wn.2d at 310, 312\n\n       (prosecutor committed misconduct when he referred to the defendant as a'\"drunken\n\n        homosexual'\" even though the State's own witnesses testified that the defendant had\n\n        not appeared drunk); State v. Boehning, 127 Wn. App. 511, 518-23, 111 P.3d 899\n\n       (2005)(prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that the jury could infer that\n\n        child witness's out-of-court statements were even more damaging to defendant than\n\n        her in-court statements were).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   63\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Schierman appears to suggest that the State needed expert testimony to\n\n        support its \"sexual conclusions\" because these conclusions were so prejudicial.\n\n        There is no support for this argument in the case law.^^\n\n              IX.    The Presence of Soldiers in Uniform at the Trial, Coupled with\n                     Testimony That Leonid Was Deployed in a Combat Zone When the\n                     Murders Occurred, Did Not Violate Fourteenth Amendment Due\n                     Process Protections or Sixth Amendment Rights to Confrontation and\n                     an Impartial Jury\n              The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\n\n        guarantee a criminal defendant the fundamental right to a fair trial.

Ed. 2d 482\n\n       (2006). That right may be violated where the \"courtroom arrangement\" created a\n\n        risk that \"'impermissible factors'\" would influence the jury. Holbrook v. Flynn,475\n\n        U.S. 560, 570, 106 S. Ct. 1340,89 L.Ed. 2d 525(1986){quotingEstelle v. Williams,\n\n        425 U.S. 501, 505,96 S. Ct. 1691,48 L. Ed. 2d 126(1976)).

Ed. 2d 1 (2006), an \"actual innocence\" case in which the Supreme Court noted that\n        \"[wjhen identity is in question, motive is key.\" House held that new DNA evidence,\n        proving that semen on the victim's clothing did not come from the petitioner, was material\n        even though \"neither sexual contact nor motive were elements ofthe offense.\" Id. at 540.\n        It does not address the relationship between closing argument and the record.\n                                                   64\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       testimony that he was deployed in Iraq at the time ofthe murders and(2)the presence\n        of uniformed military personnel in the courtroom audience.\n\n                     A. Facts\n\n\n              Leonid, Olga's husband and Andrew and Justin's father, was a United States\n\n        soldier stationed in Iraq at the time ofthe murders. On October 28,2009,the defense\n\n        filed \"Defendant's Motion to Preclude Soldiers in Fatigues from Attending\n\n        Proceedings.\" CP at 6443. It stated that defense counsel expected that uniformed\n\n        soldiers would attend the trial, and that this expectation was \"based on prior\n\n        experience on this case, where the usual practice has been for soldiers in fatigues to\n\n        sit in the courtroom, behind the prosecutor's table, close to and in full view [of]\n\n        jurors who will not only decide whether Schierman committed the offense, but also\n        whether he will live or die.\" CP at 6444. Defense counsel requested in the\n\n        alternative that the court permit videotaping ofthe courtroom audience.\n\n              The trial court heard oral arguments on the motion on November 5, 2009. At\n\n        that hearing, defense counsel noted that Leonid had been appearing in uniform,\n\n        acknowledged that \"he ha[d] every right to do so,\" and requested that the court\n\n        instruct the prosecution not to tell the jury that Leonid had been deployed in Iraq\n\n        when the murder took place. VRP (Nov. 5, 2009) at 9. The defense requested that\n\n        the jury be told only that Leonid was out of the country at the time. The State\n\n        opposed all of the defense motions related to military service.\n                                                 65\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              The trial court denied the motion to exclude soldiers in uniform from the\n\n        courtroom. It reasoned that \"the limited presence of military personnel\" did not\n\n        infringe on Schierman's constitutional rights because it was not a comment on guilt\n\n        or irmocence. Id. at 20. It also denied defense counsel's alternative motion to permit\n\n        videotaping.\n\n              The trial court did, however, limit \"references to [Leonid]'s status as follows:\n\n        That he was in the military, on active duty at that time, and stationed outside of the\n\n        United States at the time ofthese crimes.\" VRP (Jan. 20,2010)at 14. The trial court\n\n        thus excluded evidence that he was stationed in Iraq.\n\n              That order was violated almost immediately. At trial, Leonid was the State's\n\n        first witness. At first, he testified that he was a soldier stationed at Fort Lewis, but\n\n        then later stated that when the murders occurred he \"came back on emergency leave\n\n        from Iraq, from overseas.\" Id. at 100, 108. This violated the in limine ruling in\n\n        Schierman's favor; defense counsel did not call further attention to it, though—^he\n\n        did not object when the violation occurred. Later, the State asked Leonid about his\n\n        communications with his wife while he was stationed overseas. Leonid responded\n\n        that \"[sjometimes my base would be mortared, and that [would] knock out\n\n        communications.\" Id. at 167. The defense objected that the testimony was\n\n        irrelevant. The trial court overruled the objection, and Leonid continued, \"[A]lso,\n\n\n\n                                                  66\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        whenever soldiers would get killed, a complete communication blackout would be\n\n        imposed on our base.\" Id.\n\n              After the jury was excused, defense counsel renewed its objection and referred\n\n        to the in limine ruling, asserting that the State was \"back-dooring in the fact that\n\n       [Leonid] was fighting overseas.\" Id. at 170. The trial court asked the prosecutor to\n\n        explain the relevance of questions about Leonid's communications with his wife.\n\n        The prosecutor claimed these questions were relevant \"to establish what type of\n        communication was available from inside the Milkin residence, were there land\n\n        lines, were there cell phones?\" Id. at 171. But the prosecutor also apologized to\n\n        defense counsel and the court.\n\n\n              The court directed the prosecutor to have another discussion with Leonid\n\n        regarding the limits on his testimony. It also told Leonid that if he made further\n\n        references to his service in Iraq, the court would instruct the jury that he was in\n\n        violation of a court order. The defense moved for a mistrial and, in the alternative,\n\n        for a limiting instruction. The court denied the motion for a mistrial, finding that\n\n        \"the nature ofthe restrictions is not such that a violation ofthem ... rises to the level\n\n        of creating unfair prejudice to the defendant for violating his rights to a fair trial.\"\n\n        Id. at 175.\n\n\n               The court did give a limiting instruction, though. The following day. Judge\n\n        Canova admonished the jury to disregard all testimony \"regarding [Leonid] being\n                                                   67\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

Defense\n\n        counsel stated for the record that \"there are three friends of[Leonid] in uniform in\n\n        court, and he appeared yesterday in court in uniform.\" Id. at 8.\n\n              About one month later, defense counsel renewed its objection to the presence\n\n        of soldiers in uniform: \"Throughout this trial we've had two ordinarily uniformed\n\n        military people not only sitting in court, but sitting outside ... as jurors come in. . .\n\n        . It happens every day, and . . . they sit directly on a bench in front of the doors, as\n\n        the jurors come in.\" VRP (Feb. 18, 2010) at 10. The court disagreed with that\n\n        characterization:\"For the record,I have not noticed individuals sitting in front ofthe\n\n        doors of the courtroom in military fatigues or otherwise in military uniform except\n\n\n\n                 The defense offered an alternative instruction stating:\n\n                      The court has previously ruled that the nature and location of Leonid\n               Milkin's military service in July 2006 is irrelevant. The prosecutor pursued\n               a line of questioning yesterday regarding phone contact between Leonid\n               Milkin and Olga Milkin while in the military. The answers elicited by the\n               prosecutor regarding the location and nature of Mr. Milkin's military service\n               w[ere] irrelevant to these proceedings and violated the court's prior order.\n               The questions and answers regarding the nature and location of Mr. Milkin's\n               military service is stricken and the jury is instructed to disregard such\n               testimony.\n\n        CP at 7395-96. Judge Canova rejected the proffered language, stating that he did \"not want\n        those kinds of personal references as to opposing counsel. They are completely\n        unprofessional and inappropriate, and if I hear those kinds of comments again from either\n        side, that are personal attacks on opposing counsel, you will be subject to sanctions for\n        contempt of court.\" VRP (Jan. 21, 2010) at 7.\n\n\n                                                    68\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

It\n\n       declined to change its prior ruling on the issue, concluding that there was no\n\n       indication that any courtroom spectators had improperly influenced the jury.\n\n              Schierman argues that these events deprived him of his Fourteenth\n\n        Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation and\n\n        an impartial jury.\n\n                     B. Analysis\n              A defendant alleging that the \"courtroom arrangement\" rendered his trial\n\n        unfair bears the burden of showing that the courtroom arrangement was inherently\n\n        prejudicial. Holbrook,475 U.S. at 570.^^ A trial court's determination that spectator\n\n        conduct is not inherently prejudicial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.

First, he cites cases holding that the appearance ofabnormal security measures\n\n        can deprive a defendant of due process. Appellant's Opening Br. at 80-81 (citing\n\n        Holbrook, 475 U.S. at 572; State v.

Finally, he cites cases holding that a defendant charged with\n\n        an offense against a law enforcement officer was denied a fair trial when large\n\n        numbers of the victim's colleagues attended the trial in uniform. Id. at 83 (citing\n\n        Woods V. Dugger,923 F.2d 1454(11th Cir. 1991); Shootes v. Florida, 20 So. 3d 434\n\n        (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2009); United States v. Johnson, 713 F.

In Norris, the defendant's rape trial was attended daily by at least three\n\n        women wearing buttons that read,'\"Women Against Rape.'\" 918 F.2d at 830-31.\n\n        The Ninth Circuit held that this deprived the defendant of a fair trial because it\n\n        conveyed a message that he was guilty: \"Just as the compelled wearing of prison\n\n        garb during trial can create an impermissible influence on the jury throughout trial,\n\n        the buttons' message, which implied that Norris raped the complaining witness,\n                                                  70\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

The Woods court concluded that the ribbons were a tribute to the\n\n        victim and an expression of mourning, rather than a comment on the defendant's\n\n        guilt. Id. This court reaffirmed that holding in Lord III, distinguishing trial\n\n        spectators' \"silent displays of affiliation\" with the victim—in that case, the wearing\n\n        of buttons displaying an in-life photograph ofthe deceased—from spectator conduct\n\n        that \"explicitly advocate[s] guilt or innocence.\" 161 Wn.2d at 287-90.\n\n               The wearing of military uniforms by some spectators at Schierman's trial is,\n\n        like the wearing of buttons or ribbons in Lord III and Woods, a display of affiliation.\n\n        Applying that precedent, we hold that the wearing of a military uniform is\n\n        distinguishable from the wearing of\"Women Against Rape\" buttons in Harris, and\n\n        that it did not violate Schierman's right to a fair trial.\n\n               Finally, the third line of cases Schierman cites is distinguishable by the\n\n        number of uniformed spectators involved. The defendant in Dugger was convicted\n\n        of killing a prison guard and sentenced to death. 923 F.2d at 1455. His trial took\n\n        place in a small town whose economy centered on the prison where the crime\n                                                    71\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The trial received a great deal of publicity and was\n\n        attended daily by a full courtroom of spectators, about half of whom were prison\n\n        guards in uniform. Id. at 1458-59. The Eleventh Circuit held that these elements\n\n        combined to create an atmosphere that deprived the defendant of his Sixth\n\n        Amendment right to a fair trial. Id. at 1460.\n\n              In Shootes, the defendant was charged with assaulting a narcotics officer. 20\n\n        So. 3d at 436. During the final stages of the trial, between 35 and 70 uniformed\n\n        narcotics officers were present in the courtroom, constituting at least half of the\n\n        spectators. Id. Further complicating matters, the nature of the narcotics officers'\n\n        uniforms was an issue in the trial because the defendant argued that he had not\n\n        known his victim was an officer. Id. at 439. Distinguishing cases in which the\n\n        officers were fewer in number and less visible to the jury, the Florida Court of\n\n        Appeals held that the law enforcement presence violated the defendant's Sixth and\n\n        Fourteenth Amendment rights to a fair trial. Id.\n\n              Finally, in Johnson, the defendant was charged with shooting a security\n\n        officer during a bank robbery; he was convicted and sentenced to death. 713 F.\n\n        Supp. 2d at 603. During the testimony of an officer present at the robbery, more\n\n        than 40 uniformed members of the \"Sherriffs Office\" attended the trial. Id. at 616.\n\n        Defense counsel objected and asked the court to instruct the officers not to appear in\n\n        uniform. Id. The court denied the request. Id.

M at 617. It concluded that the error did not deprive the defendant\n\n        of a fair trial since it resulted in only one day of significant police presence, but that\n\n        it was \"a small part[] ofthe overall totality of circumstances justifying a new penalty\n\n        hearing.\" Id.\n\n              To the extent that we have a record regarding the presence of uniformed\n\n        soldiers in the courtroom, that record indicates that there were at most two or three\n\n        uniformed soldiers attending the trial on any given day. It does not indicate that the\n\n       jury was exposed to the kind of show of force at issue in Dugger, Shootes, and\n\n        Johnson. Given the small number of spectators who attended Schierman's trial in\n\n        military uniform, the jury is likely to have assumed, at most, that a few of Leonid's\n\n        colleagues were in the courtroom to support Leonid. This situation, even in\n\n        combination with the erroneous admission of testimony that Leonid served in Iraq,\n\n        is readily distinguishable from the facts in Dugger,Shootes, and Johnson. In those\n\n        cases, the overwhelming presence of law enforcement in the courtroom, combined\n\n        with the nature ofthe charges, signaled to the jury that the many spectators \"wanted\n\n        a conviction.\" Shootes, 20 So. 3d at 439 {citing Dugger,923 F.3d at 1460).\n\n               For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n\n        motion to prohibit military uniforms in the courtroom.

The Guilt Phase Jury Instructions Did Not Violate Fourteenth\n                       Amendment Due Process Protections\n\n              Schierman argues that the trial court violated Fourteenth Amendment due\n\n        process clause protections when it denied three separate defense requests for jury\n\n        instructions. U.S. Const, amend. XIV. He assigns error to (1) the denial of the\n\n        defense's proposed instructions differentiating between \"premeditation\" and\n\n       \"intent,\" (2) the denial of the defense's proposed instructions on voluntary\n\n        intoxication, and (3) the denial of the defense's request for a manslaughter\n\n        instruction.\n\n\n                       A. Schierman's proposed instruction          differentiating     between\n                         \"premeditation\" and \"intent\"\n\n                          1. Facts\n\n\n              The trial court gave the standard pattern jury instruction on \"[pjremeditation\":\n\n        WPIC 26.01.01.       11 Washington Practice:           Washington Pattern Jury\n\n        Instructions: Criminal 26.01.01 (3d ed. 2008) (WPIC). CP at 7834. That\n\n        instruction reads as follows:\n\n                   Premeditated means thought over beforehand. When a person, after\n              any deliberation, forms an intent to take human life, the killing may\n              follow immediately after the formation ofthe settled purpose and it will\n              still be premeditated. Premeditated must involve more than a moment\n\n\n                                                  74\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The defense objected to that instruction on the ground that it could not be\n\n        distinguished from the WPIC on \"intent\"\n\n              Any intent must involve more than \"a moment in time\" and WPICs\n              26.01.01 and 10.01 have no discernible difference. Murder 1° requiring\n              premeditation and Murder 2° requiring intent (i.e., acting with\n              \"objective or purpose\") have no difference - both Murder 1° and\n              Murder 2° require a \"thinking it over beforehand\" to accomplish \"a\n              result that constitutes a crime.\" Accordingly, the defense requests the\n              United States Supreme Court's definition in [Fisher v. United States,\n              328 U.S. 463, 467 n.3, 66 S. Ct. 1318, 90 L. Ed. 1382(1946)] with the\n              emphasis on prior deliberation.\n\n        CP at 7653.\n\n\n              The defense proposed three alternative instructions on \"premeditation.\" The\n\n        first read as follows:\n\n\n                 Deliberation is consideration and reflection upon the preconceived\n              design to kill; turning it over in the mind; giving it second thought.\n\n                 Although formation of a design to kill may be instantaneous, as\n              quick as thought itself, the mental process of deliberating upon such a\n              design does require that an appreciable time elapse between formation\n              ofthe design and the fatal act within which there is, in fact deliberation.\n\n                 The law prescribes no particular period oftime. It necessarily varies\n              according to the peculiar circumstances of each case. Consideration of\n              a matter may continue over a prolonged period—hours, days or even\n              longer. Then again, it may cover but a brief span of minutes. If one\n              forming an intent to kill does not act instantly, but pauses and actually\n\n\n                 WPIC 10.01 defines \"intent\" as \"aeting with the objeetive or purpose to\n        aeeomplish a result that constitutes a crime.\" 11 WPIC 10.01, at 217.\n                                                 75\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The court refused all of these alternatives and, over defense objection,\n\n        gave the standard WPIC \"premeditation\" instruction. VRP (Feb. 7, 2010) at 13-17.\n\n                        2.

Id.\n\n              This court has upheld the WPIC on premeditation in numerous cases, rejecting\n\n        the precise argument that Schierman makes here.

This court has held that Washington's\n\n        pattern instructions on '\"premeditation\"' and '\"intent,\"' at least when used in\n\n        combination, make the distinction between these concepts \"abundantly clear.\" Rice,\n\n        110 Wn.2d at 603-04. It has also held that WPIC 26.01.01 properly defines\n\n        \"premeditation,\" accurately states the law, and is not misleading. Clark, 143 Wn.2d\n\n        at 771.\n\n\n              Schierman acknowledges this line of cases, but asks this court to \"reconsider\n\n        the pattern instructions because they do not differentiate between intent and\n\n        premeditation in any meaningful way.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 89.\n\n\n\n                                                77\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Schierman timely objected and offered his own instructions on this point.\n\n        Schierman's proposed instructions are good alternatives to the pattern instruction;\n\n        certainly, the trial court would not have erred by giving any of those alternative\n\n        instructions. But Schierman does not offer any argument that this court has not\n\n        previously addressed, and he does not show that our prior precedent on this issue is\n\n        incorrect and harmful. We therefore decline his invitation to overrule that precedent.\n\n              Alternatively, Schierman argues that his Fourteenth Amendment right to due\n\n        process was violated when the State used a baseball analogy in closing argument to\n\n        explain the difference between \"intent\" and \"premeditation.\" Id. at 90-93; U.S.\n\n        Const, amend. XIV. Schierman does not allege that this analogy constituted\n\n        prosecutorial misconduct, and he does not cite any authority for the assertion that it\n\n       resulted in a due process violation. We therefore reject it.\n\n                     B. Schierman's proposed instruction on voluntary intoxication\n\n                        1. Facts\n\n\n              The defense proposed the following instruction on voluntary intoxication:\n\n                 The prosecution must prove that the defendant committed\n              Aggravated First Degree Murder with premeditation and/or Murder in\n              the Second Degree with intent. The defendant contends that he did not\n              have the required intent and mental state due in whole or part to his\n              intoxication. However, the defendant does not need to prove that he\n              did not have the required intent and mental state.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 78\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n                 If you have a reasonable doubt about whether the defendant\n              committed the crime with premeditation, intent, criminal recklessness\n              or criminal negligence, you must find the defendant not guilty.\n\n        CP at 7654. The court denied that request and gave the standard WPIC on voluntary\n\n        intoxication instead:\n\n\n                 No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary\n              intoxication is less criminal by reason of that condition. However,\n              evidence ofintoxication may be considered in determining whether the\n              defendant acted with intent or premeditation.\n\n        CP at 7849. The defense objected to the first sentence of that instruction, arguing\n\n        that it \"seems to contradict and vitiate the next line.\" VRP (Apr. 7, 2010) at 17-18.\n\n        The court rejected that argument because the WPIC mirrored the language in RCW\n\n        9A.16.090, the Washington criminal code statute addressing voluntary intoxication.\n\n        Id. at 18.\n\n\n                        2. Analysis\n               Schierman contends that the trial court should have omitted the first sentence\n\n        ofthe WPIC on voluntary intoxication because that sentence renders the instruction\n\n        \"Montradictorv and lalmbiguous.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 93. He is correct\n\n        that there is some tension between the first sentence, implying that intoxication is\n\n        not relevant to the question ofguilt, and the second sentence,stating that intoxication\n\n        \"may be\" relevant to guilt. CP at 7849. But he does not show that the trial court\n\n        erred. He contends that the trial court should instead have borrowed language from\n\n\n                                                  79\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Coates, however, neither held nor\n\n        implied that there is anything wrong with the WPICs on voluntary intoxication. It\n\n        held only that neither party bears the burden of proof on voluntary intoxication. Id.\n\n        at 891. In reaching that conclusion, the Coates court actually approved of a jury\n\n        instruction that exactly tracked the language of Washington's voluntary intoxication\n\n        defense statute, RCW 9A.16.090, which provides:\n\n              No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication\n              shall be deemed less criminal by reason of his condition, but whenever\n              the actual existence ofany particular mental state is a necessary element\n              to constitute a particular species or degree of crime, the fact of his\n              intoxication may be taken into consideration in determining such\n               mental state.\n\n\n        Id. at 889.\n\n\n               Schierman also argues that the voluntary intoxication instruction should have\n\n        \"appl[ied] to the aggravating factor of common scheme or plan.\" Appellant's\n\n        Opening Br. at 94.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Schierman argues that evidence of his intoxication raised an inference that he\n\n        committed manslaughter: \"[T]he defense presented evidence that Schierman was\n\n        severely intoxicated at the time of the offense.

Dr. Saxon interviewed Schierman in November 2006 and\n\n        February 2007 regarding the events of July 16 and 17, 2006 (the time of the\n\n        murders). He also reviewed Schierman's medical and addiction treatment records.\n\n              In the interviews, Schierman told Dr. Saxon that he had consumed one 375-\n\n        milliliter bottle of vodka at work on July 16, 2006, and taken three or four more\n\n        bottles home with him. Based on Schierman's self-reporting, and on the fact that\n\n        detectives had recovered three empty vodka bottles from Schierman's bedroom three\n\n        days after the murders. Dr. Saxon formed the \"opinion\" that Schierman drank\n\n        heavily on the evening of July 16, 2006. VRP (Apr. 1, 2010) at 106-07.\n\n              Two witnesses who saw Schierman on July 16, 2006, testified that if\n\n        Schierman was drinking that night, he hid it from them. Schierman's roommate at\n\n        the time, Way,testified that although he had not seen Schierman drinking that night,\n\n        he later remembered Schierman acting \"more outgoing than usual, more jovial,\"\n\n                                                 82\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Analysis\n              Schierman argues that the trial court committed reversible error by denying\n\n        his request for the manslaughter instruction. The State disagrees, contending that no\n\n        error occurred and that if any did, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We\n\n        agree with Schierman that the trial court erred when it refused to give the\n\n        manslaughter instruction, but we conclude that the error was harmless beyond a\n\n        reasonable doubt.\n\n\n              A party is entitled to have the jury instructed on a lesser included offense if\n\n        that offense satisfies the two-pronged test this court established in State v. Workman,\n\n        90 Wn.2d 443, 447-48, 584 P.2d 382 (1978). Under the first prong {Workman's,\n\n        legal prong), the offense must consist solely of elements necessary to conviction of\n\n        a greater offense charged. Id. at 448. Under the second prong {Workman's factual\n\n        prong), the evidence must support an inference that only the lesser offense was\n\n        committed, to the exclusion ofthe greater offense charged.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              In this case, the State concedes that Workman''s legal prong is met, since first\n\n        and second degree manslaughter consist solely of elements necessary to conviction\n\n        of first degree (premeditated) murder. Br. of Resp't at 157 (citing State v. Warden,\n\n        133 Wn.2d 559, 562-63, 947 P.2d 708(1997); State v. Berlin, 133 Wn.2d 541, 550-\n\n        51, 947 P.2d 700 (1997); see also State v. Jones, 95 Wn.2d 616, 621, 628 P.2d 472\n\n       (1981) (if prosecution proves intent, it necessarily proves recklessness and\n\n        negligence); State v.

Alternatively,\n\n        it argues that any error in denying the manslaughter instruction was harmless\n\n        because by rejecting a conviction for second degree murder, the jury necessarily\n\n        rejected any lesser conviction as well. Id.\n\n              A trial court's refusal to give instructions to a jury is reviewed for abuse of\n\n        discretion if it is based on a factual determination. Walker, 136 Wn.2d at 772. Here,\n\n        the trial court made a factual determination that the evidence did not support an\n\n        inference that Schierman committed manslaughter (a reckless or negligent\n\n\n\n                                                 85\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Taken together, these three rulings indicate that the trial\n\n        court believed the evidence supported an inference that Schierman was too\n\n        intoxicated to premeditate the murders, but not an inference that he was too\n\n        intoxicated to intend the murders. Schierman argues that this was error: since the\n\n        evidence supported giving the voluntary intoxication instruction, which told the jury\n\n        that intoxication might diminish intent, the trial court should have instructed the jury\n\n        on manslaughter—a homicide offense with a lesser mental state (recklessness or\n\n        negligence) than intent to kill.\n\n              The case law supports Schierman's position on this point. In State v. Colwash,\n\n        15 Wn. App. 530, 531-33, 550 P.2d 57 (1976), aff'd, 88 Wn.2d 468, 564 P.2d 781\n\n        (1977), the defendant was convicted of second degree murder, which the evidence\n\n        showed he committed \"by stabbing [the victim] with a knife.\" The court instructed\n\n        the jury that the homicide was neither excusable norjustifiable, but that\"intoxication\n\n        could be considered in determining the presence ofintent.\" Id. at 531. It also denied\n\n        the defendant's request for a manslaughter instruction.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n               The Court of Appeals reversed the convietidn in Colwash, holding that the\n\n        defendant was entitled to the manslaughter instruction because \"[t]he giving of an\n\n        intoxication instruction created for the jury a question as to whether defendant\n\n        possessed the requisite premeditation and/or intent to kill required for murder.\" Id.\n\n        This court affirmed the Court of Appeals. Colwash, 88 Wn.2d at 470-71. We\n\n        reached the same conclusion in Berlin, where the defendant was found holding a\n\n        shotgun and standing over his dead friend after an evening of heavy drinking. 133\n\n        Wn.2d at 549. We upheld the defendant's right to a manslaughter instruction,\n\n        reasoning that \"ample evidence was offered of Berlin's drinking to the point of\n\n        potentially impairing his ability to form the requisite intent to kill.\" Id. at 552. And\n\n        although Warden, 133 Wn.2d 559, involved a diminished capacity defense instead\n\n        ofa voluntary intoxication instruction, its reasoning supports Schierman's argument\n\n        in this case.^^ In that case, the defendant \"disguised herself as a delivery person and\n\n\n\n                  The State argues that Warden is inapposite because in that case, the defense\n        presented expert testimony that posttraumatic stress disorder diminished the defendant's\n        capacity for intent.

Id.\n\n              In this case, testimony that Schierman was in an alcoholic blackout when the\n\n        murders occurred created the same factual question that existed in Colwash, Berlin,\n\n        and Warden: whether, ifthe defendant did commit the acts charged, he or she did so\n\n        with the conscious intent necessary to constitute intentional, as opposed to reckless\n\n        or negligent, murder. This is why the trial court—albeit, in an \"abundance of\n\n        caution\"—gave the voluntary intoxication instruction.

The State argues that this\n\n        verdict implicitly rejects every lesser offense included in first degree premeditated\n\n        murder, and that we can therefore be sure that a manslaughter instruction would have\n\n        made no difference.\n\n\n              We recently rejected a similar argument in State v. Condon, where the\n\n        defendant was charged with first degree premeditated murder and first degree felony\n\n        murder, the trial court erroneously refused an instruction on the lesser included\n\n        offense ofsecond degree intentional murder, and the jury convicted the defendant of\n\n        premeditated murder (the greatest crime charged) instead of first degree felony\n\n        murder. 182 Wn.2d 307, 313, 326, 343 P.3d 357 (2015). In holding that the trial\n\n        court's instructional error was not harmless, we rejected the argument that simply\n\n        by instructing the jury on the definitions of premeditation and intent, the trial court\n\n        effectively emphasized the legal distinction between first degree premeditated and\n\n        second degree intentional murder. Compare State v. Condon,noted at 174 Wn. App.\n\n        1041, 2013 WL 1628247, at *7 (\"[t]he instructions given with respect to\n\n        [premeditated murder and felony murder] did not draw the jury's attention to the\n\n        difference between premeditation and intent\"), with Condon, 182 Wn.2d at 333-34\n\n        (Gonzalez, J., dissenting)(pointing out that the jury was actually instructed on the\n\n        definitions of \"intent\" and \"premeditation,\" and arguing that this sufficed to draw\n\n        the jury's attention to the difference).\n\n                                                   89\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

In Schierman's case, the relevant legal distinction\n\n        was between intentional murder(committed by a person whose level ofintoxication\n\n        prevented him from premeditating his offenses) and reckless or negligent murder\n\n        (committed by a person whose intoxication prevented him even from intending those\n\n        offenses). Unlike the instructions given in Condon, the instructions given in\n\n        Schierman's case called the jury's attention to this distinction—and to the defense\n\n        theory that Schierman was in a state of alcoholic blackout when the murders\n\n        occurred.\n\n\n              This is because even though Schierman's jury was not instructed on\n\n        manslaughter, it was instructed on voluntary intoxication.          That instruction\n\n        specifically called the jury's attention to Schierman's intoxication evidence, and it\n\n        specifically told the jury that it could consider this evidence when deciding whether\n\n        the defendant had premeditated or intended the murders. Having heard this\n\n        instruction, the jury nevertheless found that Schierman premeditated the murders—\n\n        that is, it found that he committed the murders with the most conscious and culpable\n\n        mental state. On this record, and given these instructions, there is only one possible\n\n        explanation for that verdict: the jury did not credit the theory that an alcoholic\n\n        blackout diminished Schierman's capacity to premeditate. There is no possibility\n\n        that a manslaughter instruction would have led the jury to a different conclusion.\n                                                 90\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Having\n\n        found only one instructional error and that this error is harmless, we also reject\n\n        Schierman's argument that cumulative instructional error warrants reversal of his\n\n        conviction.\n\n\n                                      Penalty Phase Issues\n\n\n              Schierman raises several challenges to his death sentence. We hold that in\n\n        most respects, the experienced trial court judge correctly applied a complicated set\n\n        of constitutional and evidentiary rules to a contentious and emotionally charged\n\n        proceeding.\n\n              However, I disagree with the trial court's decisions to exclude important\n\n        mitigating evidence proffered by defense expert witnesses. I conclude that those\n\n        errors require reversal of the death sentences. And they would ordinarily require a\n\n        remand to permit the State to proceed to a new sentencing phase. But this court is\n\n        also required by statute to analyze whether imposing a sentence of death in each\n\n        particular case is proportionate. I further conclude that the sentences ofdeath violate\n\n        Washington's prohibition on disproportionate capital sentencing. For that reason, I\n\n        would reverse the sentences of death and remand with instructions to impose the\n\n        only lawful sentence available for these crimes: four consecutive sentences of life\n\n        in prison without possibility of parole.\n                                                   91\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Facts\n\n              In opening statements during the penalty phase,the defense mentioned for the\n\n        first time that it planned to call Dr. Mark Cunningham, a clinical and forensic\n\n        psychologist, to testify regarding Schierman's lack of future dangerousness in\n\n        prison. The State objected that the defense had never disclosed its intent to call Dr.\n\n        Cunningham to testify on any topic other than the phenomenon of alcoholic\n\n        blackout. The defense submitted an offer of proof later that evening. This offer\n\n        summarized Dr. Cunningham's proposed testimony on future dangerousness and\n\n        mentioned a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation.\n\n              The next day, the trial court found that the defense had no \"possible . . .\n\n        legitimate basis ... for this incredibly untimely disclosure of an absolutely new and\n\n        previously unrelated scope of expert testimony.\" VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 15-16.\n\n        The trial court did not, however, penalize Schierman for his lawyers' lateness: it\n\n        specifically denied a motion to exclude Dr. Cunningham's testimony due to untimely\n\n        disclosure. Instead, it postponed ruling on admissibility and directed the defense to\n\n        provide the State with a copy of the proposed PowerPoint presentation.\n\n\n                                                 92\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

CP\n\n        at 8302. Many of the slides depicted rates of violence among various groups of\n\n        inmates in different state and federal prisons. Overall, they conveyed the message\n\n        that inmates sentenced to death or life without parole are less likely than other\n\n        inmates to commit violent acts in prison. The presentation culminated in three slides\n\n        titled \"Individualized Actuarial Likelihood of Conner Schierman Committing a\n\n        Prison Assault,\" and several slides listing the \"Available Measures to Control\n\n        Disruptive or Violent Inmates\" in Washington Department of Corrections (DOC)\n\n        facilities.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              As discussed above, the State moved to exclude Dr. Cunningham's\n\n        presentation and testimony due to late disclosure and lack of relevance. The trial\n\n        court did not exclude this evidence for late disclosure.\n\n              The trial court instead excluded it for lack ofrelevance. It accepted the State's\n\n        argument on this point, which rested on Morva v. Commonwealth,278 Va. 329,350-\n\n        351, 683 S.E.2d 553 (2009). In that case, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that\n\n        the same Dr. Cunningham could not provide capital penalty phase testimony about\n\n        the Virginia DOC's \"security interventions\" because they were not relevant to the\n\n        defendant's \"character, history, and background.\" Morva, 278 Va. at 350-51. The\n\n        trial court acknowledged that testimony on future dangerousness was \"clearly . . .\n\n        allowed\" since lack of future dangerousness is a \"statutorily listed mitigat[ing]\n\n        circumstance.\" VRP(Apr. 29, 2010)at 22. But it concluded that the majority ofthe\n\n        slides in Dr. Cunningham's presentation were \"generic\" and thus irrelevant.

It reasoned that \"Dr.\n\n\n       Curmingham is still allowed to testify to the group rates, which he feels are necessary\n\n       as a concept.

Reese v. Stroh, 128 Wn.2d 300, 310,907 P.2d 282(1995).

In this case, the trial court applied the wrong standard to\n\n        exclude Dr. Cunningham's testimony. Hence, it both abused its discretion and\n\n        committed legal error.\n\n              As noted above,the trial court relied on the Virginia Supreme Court's decision\n\n        mMorva,278 Va. at 350-51,to exclude Dr. Cunningham's evidence. But the Morva\n\n        court applied Virginia precedent holding that \"a court should exclude evidence\n\n        concerning the defendant's diminished opportunities to commit criminal acts of\n\n        violence in the future due to the security conditions in the prison.\" Id.

The trial court's error in excluding Dr. Cunningham's\n                               evidence on lack of future dangerousness requires reversal\n\n                The State does not argue that any error in limiting Dr. Cunningham's evidence\n\n        on lack of future dangerousness was harmless. I can certainly understand why. Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's presentation was the defense's best evidence that Schierman posed\n\n        little threat offuture dangerousness. It was the only evidence on this issue that came\n\n        from a neutral source (an expert rather than a friend or family member). See State\n\n        V. Barry, 25 Wn.

And the trial court's ruling gutted Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's presentation by excluding its most persuasive aspect: the data\n\n                                                 104\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

Without that data, Dr. Cunningham's presentation would\n\n        have appeared to be weak, unsupported opinion testimony. Given the importance of\n\n       the excluded evidence, combined with the State's(unrebutted)suggestion to the jury\n\n        in penalty phase closing argument that Schierman's dangerousness supported a death\n\n        sentence, this exclusion constituted reversible error.\n\n                     B.

Facts\n\n\n              Along with the future dangerousness presentation included in its April 20,\n\n        2010, offer of proof, the defense offered a second PowerPoint presentation by Dr.\n\n        Cunningham.       This presentation was titled \"Conner Schierman: Adverse\n\n        Developmental Factors March 2010,\" and generally expressed the idea that\n\n        Schierman had \"diminished . . . control\" due to his traumatic childhood and the\n\n        legacy of substance abuse in his family. CP at 8271-84. The first three slides in the\n        presentation juxtapose two columns of questions, one titled \"Criminal\n\n        Responsibility\" and the other titled \"Moral Culpability.\" CP at 8288. In the\n\n        \"Criminal Responsibility\" column, four questions appear: \"Could he control\n\n        himself? Did he have a choice? Did he know right from wrong? [and] What did he\n\n        do?\" Id. In the \"Moral Culpability\" column, five related questions appear: \"What\n\n                                                 105\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

CP\n\n        at 8288-99. As the slope becomes more extreme, an upward-pointing vector on the\n\n        left hand of each slide grows longer; it is labeled \"Damaging or Impairing Factors.\"\n\n       Id. A corresponding downward-pointing vector on the right side also grows longer;\n\n        it is labeled \"Moral Culpability.\" Id.\n\n              Later in the presentation, the slides depict a tower of positive words and\n\n        phrases, such as \"Stability,\" \"Consistency,\" and \"Positive Peer Relationships,\" atop\n\n        a foundation labeled with various family and developmental circumstances. CP at\n\n        8291-92. In some ofthe slides, the foundation is labeled with neutral circumstances:\n\n       \"No family history of addiction or psychological disorder[,] No childhood\n\n        maltreatment or violence exposure[,] No developmental abandonment or\n\n        instability.\" CP at 8292. In these slides, the foundation is level and the tower\n\n        standing   straight.     In   other      slides,   the   foundation   reads, \"Family\n\n        addiction/psychological disorder[,] Childhood maltreatment and violence[,]\n\n        Developmental abandonment & instability.\" Id. In those slides, the foundation is\n\n        slanted and the tower of positive words and phrases is tilting precariously.

Once again, it criticized the defense for late disclosure.\n\n        But, once again, the trial court refrained from punishing Schierman for his lawyers'\n\n        error. It did not exclude the \"Adverse Developmental Factors\" presentation on the\n\n        ground that it was untimely disclosed. Instead, citing Oregon v. Guzek, 546 U.S.\n\n        517, 126 S. Ct. 1226, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1112 (2006), the court ruled that \"diminished\n\n        capacity goes to the issue[s] of intent and premeditation,\" which had already been\n\n        decided in the guilt phase. VRP (Apr. 30, 2010) at 9. It concluded that Dr.\n\n        Cunningham could not testify that any \"adverse developmental factors\" had\n\n        diminished Schierman's self-control because this would be tantamount to a\n\n        diminished capacity defense and therefore inconsistent with the guilt phase verdict.\n\n        Id. at 8-12.\n\n\n              The court did rule that Dr. Cunningham could testify to \"the issues relating to\n\n        moral culpability.\"    Id. at 10.

Schierman properly preserved for review the trial court's\n                               exclusion of Dr. Cunningham's testimony on diminished\n                               control\n\n              The State argues that Schierman failed to preserve any error relating to this\n\n        exclusion because he did not call Dr. Cunningham to testify. This argument fails for\n\n        the reasons given in my discussion of Dr. Cunningham's testimony on future\n\n        dangerousness.\n\n              The State also argues that any error is unpreserved because Schierman failed\n\n        to make an adequate offer of proof. ER 103(a)(2) provides that a party may not\n\n        appeal a ruling excluding evidence unless \"the admission affects a substantial right\n\n        and 'the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was\n\n        apparent fi-om the context within which questions were asked.'\" Benn II, 161 Wn.2d\n\n        at 268.\n\n\n              This argument fails as well.

To preserve a claim that evidence was erroneously\n\n        excluded, a party need only make an offer of proofthat reveals the general substance\n\n        ofthe proposed testimony. State v. Ray, 116 Wn.2d 531, 539, 806 P.2d 1220(1991)\n\n       (to preserve issue under ER 103(a)(2), record must reveal substance, but not details,\n\n        of proposed testimony). The \"Adverse Developmental Factors\" presentation meets\n\n        this standard. Accordingly, I address this assignment of error on its merits.\n\n                            b. The trial court erred in excluding Dr. Cunningham's evidence\n                               on diminished control; it was not inconsistent with the guilt\n                               phase verdict\n              The jury in Schierman's case was instructed to consider at the penalty phase:\n\n              [whether, a]t the time of the murder, the capacity of the defendant to\n              appreciate the wrongflilness of his or her conduct or to conform his or\n              her conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired\n              as a result of mental disease or defect.\n\n\n\n\n                   The State asserts that Cunningham \"struck . . . as irrelevant\" a \"list of issues\n        related to legal responsibility\" shown on three of the disputed PowerPoint slides.

This is clearly intended\n        to illustrate the distinction between guilt phase and penalty phase considerations—it does\n        not characterize any testimony as irrelevant.\n                                                   109\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

RCW 10.95.070.\n\n              The trial court excluded diminished capacity evidence, citing Guzek. The\n\n        issue presented in Guzek, however, was \"whether the State may limit the innocence-\n\n        related evidence [the defendant] can introduce at [the capital sentencing] proceeding\n\n        to the evidence he introduced at his original trial.\" 546 U.S. at 519(emphasis added).\n\n        The evidence in question was new alibi testimony, previously available to the\n\n        defendant but not offered during the guilt phase. Id. at 523. The Guzek Court held\n\n        that the Constitution does not bar the State from excluding such evidence in the\n\n        sentencing proceeding. Id. The Guzek holding rested on three rationales: (1)\n\n        sentencing concerns '\"''how, not whether, a defendant committed the crime,\"(2)the\n\n        admission of new innocence-related evidence resembles a (disfavored) collateral\n\n        attack, and (3) at the sentencing phase, the defendant could still introduce (through\n\n        transcripts) any innocence-related evidence he introduced in the guilt phase. Id. at\n\n        526-27.\n\n\n              Unlike the defendant in Guzek, Schierman did not seek to collaterally attack\n\n        his conviction. As Schierman points out, a defendant can commit a murder with\n\n        intent and premeditation while also being impaired—diminished—in his ability to\n\n        appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or conform his conduct to the\n                                                 110\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Indeed, the legislature must have contemplated that exact\n\n        scenario when it enacted RCW 10.95.070(6)—^because that subsection allows the\n\n       jury to consider that mitigating factor only after finding that the defendant\n\n        committed intentional, premeditated murder.^^\n\n              Because diminished self-control or decision-making is a relevant mitigating\n\n        factor in a capital sentencing proceeding, the trial court erred in excluding Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's testimony under Guzek.\n\n                            c. The trial court's error in excluding Dr. Cunningham's\n                               presentation on diminished control requires reversal\n\n              Like Dr. Cunningham's presentation on lack of future dangerousness, Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's presentation on diminished control was among the most persuasive\n\n        mitigating evidence offered during the penalty phase. The vast majority ofthe other\n\n        mitigation witnesses were friends or family as opposed to neutral experts. And Dr.\n\n        Cunningham was the only expert who offered admissible evidence on Schierman's\n\n        limited capacity for self-control, something that our legislature has specifically\n\n        identified as relevant in a capital sentencing proceeding. Given the significance of\n\n\n\n                  The State also argues that the mitigating faetor provided in RCW 10.95.070(6)\n        refers to an insanity defense, and that the exclusion of testimony regarding diminished\n        capacity therefore did not impair Schierman's ability to establish this mitigating factor.\n        This argument is meritless. As explained above, Schierman was not attempting to relitigate\n        the questions of intent or premeditation by presenting a diminished capacity defense.\n        Instead, he was attempting to present expert testimony linking his criminal conduct to\n        developmental influences, in contrast to conscious choice.\n                                                  Ill\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Since I am the only one who would reverse the death\n\n        sentence, though, I address Schierman's additional penalty phase claims.\n\n                     C. The trial court erred by excluding Dr. Mark McClung's testimony\n                        regarding past brain injury\n\n                        1. Facts\n\n              On April 27, 2010, the defense offered a letter by Dr. Mark McClung, a\n\n        forensic psychiatrist, stating that past brain injury might have diminished\n\n        Schierman's capacities for self-control and anger management. Dr. McClung based\n\n        this opinion on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of Schierman's brain,\n\n        conducted in July 2009; a review of that MRI by Dr. Wendy Cohen;\n\n        neuropsychological testing conducted by Dr. Paul Connor in April of 2010; and Dr.\n\n        McClung's personal interviews with Dr. Cohen and Dr. Connor.\n\n               Along with Dr. McClung's letter, the defense filed three documents:(1) the\n\n        MRI scan report,(2)an affidavit by Dr. Richard Adler stating that the MRI reflected\n\n        a 1997 concussion and that this was \"not the first incidence of brain injury suffered\n\n        by Conner Schierman,\" CP at 8249-50, and(3)a letter from Dr. Connor to Dr. Adler\n\n\n                                                 112\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       explaining that Schierman had probably suffered multiple head injuries during his\n\n        life. Dr. Connor based this opinion on the fact that \"Schierman and his family have\n\n        reported a number of incidents of domestic violence in which he was struck in the\n\n        head by his biological father.\" CP at 8257.\n\n              The State objected to Dr. McClung's testimony on the grounds that it was\n\n        offered too late and did not meet the          standard for scientific reliability. The\n\n        transcript of the argument on this issue indicates that just as the penalty phase\n\n        proceedings were beginning, Dr. Adler \"discovered what he considered to be\n\n        significant information related to a prior brain trauma\" in Schierman's medical\n\n        records, that defense counsel then marshalled several experts to investigate this\n\n        discovery, and that the defense finally offered Dr. McClung's opinion about one\n\n        week after the penalty phase proceedings began. VRP (Apr. 28, 2010) at 57-58.\n\n              Dr. McClung's letter addressed the issue of brain injury in the following,\n\n        somewhat noncommittal terms:\n\n\n              Mr. Schierman's brain injury may have had no impact on his\n              subsequent emotions or behavior. However, it is possible that it had an\n              impact on subsequent mood problems and intensity of substance abuse.\n              When Mr. Schierman was intoxicated, the brain injury may have\n              contributed to worsening any problems with loss of inhibitions,\n              interpreting his surroundings, and controlling anger/aggression.\n              Violent offending is correlated with increased incidence of brain injury\n              in offender; however, specific cause-and-effect has not been\n              established in all but a few specific cases.\n\n\n                Frye v. United States, 54 App. D.C. 46, 293 F. 1013 (1923).\n                                                 113\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n\n        CP at 8260.\n\n\n              As with Dr. Cunningham's testimony, the State objected to Dr. McClung's\n\n        testimony on the ground that it was offered too late to permit any meaningful cross-\n\n        examination. However, as with Dr. Cunningham's testimony, the court did not\n\n        exclude Dr. McClung's testimony due to late disclosure. Instead, it excluded that\n\n        testimony as speculative,\"based upon a faulty foundation,\" and not \"expressed to a\n\n        reasonable degree of medical certainty.\" VRP (Apr. 29, 2010)at 20, 6.\n\n                        2. Analysis\n              As noted above, the trial court provided two different reasons for excluding\n\n        Dr. McClung's testimony. First, it concluded that the testimony lacked an adequate\n\n        factual foundation. Second, it ruled that the testimony did not meet the threshold for\n\n        admitting expert opinion since it was not expressed to a reasonable degree ofmedical\n\n        certainty.\n\n              With respect to the first conclusion—^that Dr. McClung's testimony lacked an\n\n        adequate factual foundation—I disagree. At the hearing on Dr. McClung's\n\n        testimony, the trial court spent close to 13 minutes examining the \"chain of other\n\n        experts and their evaluations\" that Dr. McClung relied on in forming his opinion.\n\n        Id. at 7-20. This examination contains medical judgments that the court was not\n\n        qualified to make.     As noted above. Dr. McClung relied on Dr. Connor's\n\n\n                                                 114\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        neuropsychological testing report, which included Dr. Connor's opinion that\n\n        Schierman had probably suffered multiple head injuries, at the hands of his\n\n        biological father, prior to the 1997 concussion. According to Dr. Connor,the earlier\n\n        injuries were significant because they likely worsened the effects of the 1997\n\n        concussion: \"It is well documented that multiple head injuries ha[ve] a cumulative\n\n        effect such that in each subsequent injury, the negative impacts are often greater than\n\n        would be expected from one head injury in isolation.\"         CP at 8257. The trial court\n\n        rejected this theory, ruling that there was no \"foundation\" for any expert's\n\n        conclusion that Schierman had suffered multiple head injuries. VRP(Apr.29,2010)\n\n        at 20.\n\n\n                 It is not entirely clear why the court reached that conclusion. Certain parts of\n\n        the transcript indicate that the court believed the MRI conclusively proved that\n\n        Schierman had suffered only one brain injury.^^ (According to the offer of proof,\n\n        the MRI revealed that Schierman had suffered at least one, but not necessary only\n\n\n\n\n                 In his affidavit in support ofDr. McClung's proposed testimony. Dr. Adler stated\n        that \"the effect(s) of the 1997 [concussion reflected in the MRI] was/were likely made\n        more serious by precedent head trauma.\" CP at 8250.\n\n                  VRP(Apr. 29,2010)at 8(\"Dr. Cowen's re-evaluation ofthe MRI[]... concludes\n        that... there was evidence of a prior insult — that is singular\"), 15 (\"[Dr. Adler] does seem\n        to ignore [Dr. Cowen's] conclusion, as Dr. Connor did, that there was evidence of one, a,\n        prior injury or insult... shown in the rereading ofthe MRI.\").\n\n\n                                                    115\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        one, concussion.) But the majority of the court's comments on the issue indicate\n\n        that it just didn't think that Schierman's father hit Schierman hard enough or often\n\n        enough in the head to sustain any expert's conclusion that Schierman had suffered\n\n        multiple head injuries.'^®\n\n               This medical conclusion exceeded the trial court's expertise. Both Schierman\n\n        and his sister told Dr. Cunnningham about an incident in which their biological\n\n        father picked Schierman up and slammed him face first into a brick hearth. This\n\n        occurred when Schierman was 9 or 10 years old.                    Schierman also told Dr.\n\n        Cunningham that his father often shook him so hard that his head flopped back and\n\n        forth, and that his father threw him against walls and kicked him down stairs.\n\n        Schierman's mother reported that Schierman's father slapped him so hard that it left\n\n        marks.\n\n\n               It is not clear whether Dr. McClung would have testified that these prior\n\n        injuries likely worsened the effects of Schierman's documented 1997 concussion—\n\n        his proposed testimony did not explicitly endorse that particular portion of Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                  E.g., id. at 13-14(\"[In his interview with Dr. Cunningham,[t]he defendant relates\n        this incident that his sister [also] related . . . where their father grabbed the defendant and\n        threw him face first on to the brick hearth.

The trial court, by contrast, was not qualified to assess the probable\n\n        medical consequences of Schierman's childhood abuse. Therefore, it should not\n\n        have excluded Dr. McClung's testimony for inadequate \"foundation.\" Id.\n\n               The trial court's second ruling—that Dr. McClung's opinion was inadmissible\n\n        because it was not expressed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty—^presents\n\n        a more complicated legal question. Under normal (non-capital-sentencing phase)\n\n        evidentiary standards, expert medical opinion testimony is inadmissible unless it is\n\n        expressed to a \"reasonable[]medical certainty\" or \"reasonable medical probability.\"\n\n        Anderson v. Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc., 172 Wn.2d 593, 606-07, 260 P.3d 857\n\n       (2011). Schierman—understandably—does not argue that Dr. McClung's proposed\n\n        testimony met this standard. Instead, he argues that the \"reasonable medical\n\n        certainty\" standard does not apply to mitigating expert testimony in a capital\n\n        sentencing proceeding.

Appellant's Opening Br. at 124. Ellis does not stand for that\n        principle. In Ellis, the trial court excluded a significant amount of expert testimony on\n        diminished capacity on a pretrial motion in limine. 136 Wn.2d at 522-23. The Ellis court\n        held that the exclusion was premature, and that the trial court should have evaluated it\n        under ER 702, 401, and 402 instead of applying the nine separate factors articulated in\n        State V.

CP at 8260. The State is correct\n\n        that this testimony does not make thefact of Schierman's diminished control more\n\n        probable; it just establishes the possibility of that diminished control.

While Dr. McClung\n\n        did not testify that prior brain injury probably impaired Schierman's capacities, he\n\n        did testify that it possibly impaired Schierman's capacities.

Thus, even if Dr.\n\n        McClung's testimony did not establish a probability of diminished capacity, it still\n\n        might serve as a basis to impose a sentence less than death.        Dr. McClung's\n\n        testimony is therefore relevant mitigating evidence in the penalty phase.

The court clarified that Schierman's mother could testify about\n\n        \"[ojbserved behaviors . . . that she may associate with [Schierman's father's]\n\n\n\n                 E.g., CP at 26426 (cousin, Derek Huotari, would testify \"about their childhood\n        [and that] [Schierman] cared about them and treated people respectfully [and] loved\n        animals\"), 26427 (cousin Seth Justesen would testify \"regarding his experience of\n        [Schierman's] family over the years and his feeling of connectedness to [Schierman] as a\n        friend and family member), 26431 (friend ofKinsey Schierman(Schierman's sister) would\n        testify \"to [Schierman's] treating her like a sister and looking out for her [and that s]he felt\n        safe with him\"), 26430 (former employer would testify that [Schierman] was \"a hard\n        worker, car[ed] for animals and [was] a team player\").\n                                                     121\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

VRP(Apr. 13, 2010) at 29-30.\n\n        The court also ruled that no witness could testify about the impact of Schierman's\n\n        execution on other people.\n\n              The defense moved for reconsideration, submitted a more detailed offer of\n\n        proof regarding the excluded witnesses, and requested the addition of two new\n\n        categories of witness: \"family counselors\" and \"corrections officers.\" CP at 7899.\n\n        In response, the court ruled that the defense could add seven new mitigation\n\n        witnesses: the Reverend David Tinney (a \"Friend\" on the first witness list, CP at\n\n        7934), Ed Morrison (a family counselor not on the first witness list), two additional\n\n        family members from the first witness list, and three new witnesses from the\n\n        department of\"adult juvenile detention\" (not on first witness list). VRP (Apr. 15,\n\n        2010) at 104. This meant that the trial court permitted Schierman to call, in total, 37\n\n        character witnesses out of73 proposed character witnesses.\n\n              On April 19, the defense offered the testimony of Eldon Vail, the secretary of\n\n        the Washington DOC, regarding the resources and programming available to\n\n        offenders sentenced to life without parole in Washington. The court agreed that\n\n        Vail's testimony was \"certainly relevant . . . on the statutory mitigating\n\n        circumstances of future dangerousness or lack thereof,\" but ruled that if Vail\n\n\n\n                                                 122\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

VRP (Apr.\n\n        19, 2010) at 22.\n\n              Aiken's testimony covered the same general topic and thus was just as\n\n        relevant as Vail's. Aiken is a security consultant to numerous prison systems; the\n\n        defense offered his testimony on \"an inmate's overall adjustment to confinement as\n\n        well as current/future danger to society\" and \"Mr. Schierman's classification records\n\n        from the King County Correctional Facility in Seattle.\" CP at 7920, 7943, 26422.\n\n        Consistent with its limitation on Dr. Cunningham's evidence, the trial court ruled\n\n        that Aiken could testify only as to his knowledge of prisons in Washington State.\n\n        VRP(Apr. 19, 2010)at 22. But it also ruled that Vail was \"in a much better position\n\n        to testify on that than is Mr. Aiken,\" and excluded Aiken's testimony as\n\n        cumulative—z/Vail were to testify. Id.\n\n              On April 22, 2010, in response to the State's motion, the trial court excluded\n\n        testimony by Kinsey Schierman \"regarding the effects of. . . her father's anger or\n\n        his unpredictable behavior on her.\" VRP (Apr. 22, 2010) at 15. It ruled, however,\n\n        that Kinsey could testify regarding \"any observation she made of the impacts, not\n\n        her interpretation of the impact, but actual observations of impacts . . . [that her\n\n        father's] behaviors had on the defendant.\" Id. at 16.\n\n              On April 26, 2010,the trial court limited the testimony of Schierman's uncle,\n\n        Michael Christensen.

The court ruled that Christensen could testify \"to the same\n\n       scope that other family witnesses have been allowed to testify,\" but that he could not\n\n       \"relat[e] his own employment to [Schierman's] situation and how he thinks that\n\n       [Schierman] will . . . do.\" Id. at 14.\n\n              On the same day,the trial court ruled that no mitigation witnesses could testify\n\n        as to what their children did for a living or how many grandchildren they had.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        12. The court also ruled that the defense could present only 12 pieces ofSchierman's\n\n        artwork, either live or in photographs. The court denied defense counsel's request\n\n        to present a single photograph showing more than 12 pieces of artwork.\n\n                        2. Analysis\n\n              Schierman argues that the trial court committed eight errors in excluding or\n\n        limiting this mitigation testimony. We address each alleged error separately.\n\n                           a. Exclusion of mitigation character witness testimony as\n                              cumulative\n\n              Schierman contends that it was error to exclude mitigation witnesses on the\n\n        ground that their testimony was cumulative. He cites his cousin Erica Akingcoye's\n\n        proposed testimony as an example of excluded evidence that \"would have gone to\n\n        Schierman's ability to form strong social bonds with others, and to touch their lives\n\n        in positive ways.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 129 (citing CP at 7893). Schierman\n\n        argues that this type of testimony \"says something about the person [he] was when\n\n        he was not drinking or taking drugs.\" M at 130. He also argues that such testimony\n\n        should not be excluded as cumulative because \"[t]o a large extent, the sheer number\n\n        of witnesses was the very point: a person who has touched and enhanced the lives of\n\n        many people will likely be seen as more deserving of leniency.\" Id.\n\n              We know of no case holding that a trial court erred by excluding mitigating\n\n        character evidence as cumulative in a capital sentencing proceeding. But neither do\n\n\n\n                                                125\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        we know of any case in which a trial court preemptively limited the number of\n\n        mitigation character witnesses who could testify.\n\n               We do not resolve this issue here. Schierman offered character testimony by\n\n        47 non-family-member witnesses,            and the trial court excluded 30 of these\n\n        witnesses as cumulative.'^^ He also offered the testimony of26 family members,and\n\n        the trial court excluded 12 of them. VRP (Apr. 13, 2010) at 32-33; VRP (Apr. 15,\n\n        2010) at 104. In all, therefore, the trial court deprived Schierman of mitigating\n\n        character testimony by 42 individuals—^more than half of all the penalty phase\n\n\n                 There are eases, however, affirming a trial court's exclusion of written character\n        evidence as cumulative oflive witness testimony. E.g.,People v. Pearson,56 Cal. 4th 393,\n        470, 297 P.3d 793, 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 541 (trial court did not violate defendant's right to\n        due process by excluding three reference letters, describing defendant as reliable and\n        hardworking, as \"cumulative of other testimony regarding defendant's character presented\n        during the penalty phase\"), cert, denied, 134 S. Ct. 198 (2013); State v. Wise, 879 S.W.2d\n        494, 521-22(Mo. 1994)(no denial of due process where trial court excluded letter from\n        corrections officer describing defendant's talent in music, poetry, and writing; because\n        other witnesses had testified to these qualities, letter was properly excluded as cumulative),\n        overruled on other grounds by Joy v. Morrison,254 S.W.3d 885(Mo.2008);Fox v. State,\n        1989 OK CR 51,779 P.2d 562,572(where defendant presented 54 witnesses\"who testified\n        that his life had meaning to them and who felt that he should be sentenced to life\n        imprisonment rather than being given the death penalty,\" five additional affidavits\n        containing similar statements were \"needless ... cumulative evidence\"; trial court did not\n        deny defendant due process protections by excluding affidavits).\n\n               CP at 7933-35(31 \"Friends,\" five \"School\" witnesses, and 10\"Work\" witnesses),\n        7899(Morrison).\n\n                VRP (Apr. 13, 2010) at 33 (ruling that Schierman could present 15 non-family-\n        member lay witnesses); VRP (Apr. 15,2010) at 104(allowing Schierman to add Reverend\n        Tinney and Morrison).\n\n\n\n                                                    126\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        witnesses offered by the defense. And it did so not because these witnesses offered\n\n        irrelevant or unreliable testimony, but because it determined that their testimony\n\n        would delay the proceedings.\n\n              But Schierman then chose to forgo calling even the character witnesses he was\n\n        permitted to call. We therefore conclude that he did not preserve this claimed error\n\n        for review.\n\n\n                            b. Exclusion of testimony about mitigation witnesses' lives and\n                                families\n\n              Schierman asserts that the trial court prohibited mitigation witnesses from\n\n        discussing their own lives and families. He argues that this was error because those\n\n        witnesses' \"loving ...[and] pro-social\" lives were relevant in assessing the value of\n\n        their testimony on Schierman's behalf. Appellant's Opening Br. at 130-31.\n\n              The trial court, however, did not generally prohibit witnesses from\n\n        \"discussing their own lives and family relationships,\" as Schierman suggests. Id. at\n\n        130. Instead, the trial court stated once—apparently in response to testimony from\n\n        certain mitigation character witnesses—^that witnesses could not testify about how\n\n        many grandchildren they had or what their children did for a living.\n\n\n\n                See CP at 7921-22 (State's \"Memorandum in Support of Motion to Exclude\n        Cumulative Defense Penalty Phase Witnesses,\" arguing that witnesses should be excluded\n        because \"jurors have been repeatedly advised ... that this trial will conclude by late-March\n        or early April\").\n\n                                                    127\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n                Moreover, Schierman fails to identify any particular testimony that he was\n\n        unable to present as a result ofthis ruling. In fact, on April 27,the day after the court\n\n        issued this ruling, a friend of Schierman's from the Lakeside-Milam testified that\n\n        she had six grandchildren and that the eldest was being deployed to Afghanistan in\n\n        July.\n\n                This issue does not entitle Schierman to relief.\n\n                             c. Exclusion of lay opinion testimony about the effects of abuse\n                                and divorce\n\n                Schierman argues that the trial court erred by excluding lay testimony\n\n        regarding the way he was affected by domestic violence and divorce. Citing State\n\n        V. Claflin, 38 Wn. App. 847, 854, 690 P.2d 1186 (1984), he argues that such\n\n        testimony is admissible under the Rules of Evidence. He implies that even if it\n\n        weren't admissible under the Rules of Evidence, such testimony would still be\n\n        admissible in the penalty phase of a capital case.\n\n                The trial court, however, did not actually exclude testimony about\n\n        Schierman's behavior following his parents' divorce or his father's abuse. Indeed,\n\n        Schierman's mother, stepfather, and sister all testified about the way abuse and\n\n        divorce affected Schierman. VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 44, 70 (Dean Dubinsky\n\n        testifying that Schierman's childhood trauma led him to have emotional and\n\n        substance abuse problems); VRP (Apr. 22,2010) at 108-12(Kinsey testifying about\n\n\n                                                  128\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        physical and emotional abuse; testifying that she \"noticed more of a change in\n\n        [Schierman] just shortly after the separation\"); VRP (Apr. 27, 2010) at 83-88\n\n        (Wendy Dubinsky testifying about the effect that abuse and divorce had on\n\n        Schierman).\n\n              Thus, regardless of some trial court comments seeming to exclude testimony\n\n        on this topic, most of it was,in fact, admitted. Ultimately, Timothy Driver testified\n\n        that when he coached Schierman in high school, he saw signs in Schierman's\n\n        behavior that \"it was .. . uncomfortable for him at home at that time.\" VRP (Apr.\n\n        22,2010)at 40. This is consistent with the summary provided in the defense's April\n\n        9, 2010, supplemental disclosure. And after the defense filed its motion for\n\n        reconsideration, the court ruled that Morrison could testify. Although Morrison was\n\n        ultimately unavailable, the defense substituted Phyllis Roderick, Schierman's junior\n\n        high school counselor. Roderick testified that Schierman \"was a child who was\n\n        angry at dad and mom over what was going on[,]. . . who was slipping into what I\n\n        was concerned might be a depression[,]...[and who] struggl[ed] between wanting\n\n        to be the kid that he was and that need to . . . also be the caretaker for the family.\"\n\n        VRP (Apr. 27, 2010) at 41.\n\n              As for the other proffered witnesses, only Schierman's mother, Linda\n\n        Schierman, testified.   But she testified consistently with the summary in the\n\n        supplemental disclosure, describing her family's legacy ofalcoholism and the abuse\n\n                                                 129\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        that Schierman suffered at the hands ofhis biological father. Thus,it does not appear\n\n        that the court's ruling on lay opinion actually had any limiting effect on Linda\n\n        Schierman's testimony.\n\n              Finally, although Stephanie Overland and Joshua Parker did not testify, we\n\n        cannot tell from the record why the defense did not call them. As explained above,\n\n        the defense called only 12 of the 14 family member witnesses that the trial court\n\n        ultimately permitted. Both Overland and Parker were family members and thus\n\n        could have testified.\n\n\n                           d. Forcing Schierman to choose between Eldon Vail and James\n                                Aiken\n\n\n              Schierman argues that the trial court erred by forcing him to choose between\n\n        Aiken and Vail. He contends that Aiken could have offered his perspective on\n\n        prisons outside Washington State, to which Schierman might one day be transferred.\n\n        The State argues that this error is unpreserved because Schierman failed to object to\n\n        the court's April 19 ruling.\n\n              The State is correct. And, in any event, Aiken's testimony would have been\n\n        entirely cumulative of Vail's. The defense offered both Aiken and Vail as experts\n\n        on Schierman's probable conditions of confinement in the Washington State DOC.\n\n        Vail had much more direct experience with Washington's prisons than Aiken did.\n\n\n\n\n                                                130\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Exclusion of Kinsey Schierman's testimony regarding her\n                                own abuse\n\n              Schierman argues that the trial court erred by prohibiting Kinsey Schierman\n\n       from testifying about the way she was affected by her father's abuse.\n\n              The State argues that the trial court acted within its discretion when it\n\n        determined that Kinsey's experience was not relevant. It argues that the jury could\n\n        not assume that their father's abuse affected Kinsey and Schierman in similar ways\n\n        because \"Kinsey was four years younger than Schierman, testified that she suffered\n\n        an alcohol addiction but was successful in recovery, and apparently was not violent\n\n       toward others,\" and because her gender and personality were different from\n\n        Schierman's.

Christensen is both Schierman's uncle and a former corrections officer,\n\n        and the defense offered his opinion testimony on Schierman's adjustment to life in\n\n        prison.\n\n              The court ruled that Christensen could testify about his relationship with\n\n        Schierman, as a family member, but could not \"relat[e] his own employment to\n\n                                                131\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

But he failed to object to the\n\n        court's ruling. Because there was no objection, there was no colloquy on this issue.\n\n        Nor was there any relevant offer of proof, so the record does not indicate what\n\n        evidence Schierman would have presented regarding the effect of his execution on\n\n        his friends or family.

Schierman does not explain,\n\n        in either his opening or his reply brief, how he was prejudiced by the 35-photograph\n\n        limit.    When the trial court excluded 42 of the photographs offered through\n\n        Schierman's mother, it ruled that the photographs were \"not relevant or probative in\n\n        that quantity\" because many of them depicted Schierman at the same life stages.\n\n        VRP (Apr. 26, 2010) at 149. With respect to Schierman's artwork, the trial court\n\n        ruled that Schierman could present 12 separate pieces. Schierman asked to display\n\n        a single image ofhis artwork \"in such a way that it could bejust observed en mass[e],\n\n        as opposed to individual pieces,\" presumably because in that way he could present\n\n        more than 12 individual pieces.

Memorial service video\n\n              On April 15, 2010, the State offered as penalty phase evidence \"a video that\n\n        was prepared for purposes of a memorial service by the [victims'] family, which\n\n        provides . . . moving images of the four victims in this case . . .

Ed. 2d\n\n        440 (1987), overruled in part by Payne, 501 U.S. 808, the United States Supreme\n\n        Court held that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited\n\n        the presentation of victim impact evidence to a capital sentencing jury. The Booth\n\n        Court reasoned that victim impact testimony was inherently inflammatory, was\n\n        virtually impossible to rebut, and created a risk of arbitrary sentencing decisions.

We think the Booth Court was wrong in stating that this\n              kind of evidence leads to the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.\n              In the majority of cases, . . . victim impact evidence serves entirely\n              legitimate purposes. In the event that evidence is introduced that is so\n              unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due\n              Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism\n              for relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  138\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

The Gentry court\n\n        held that the addition of the victims' rights amendment (article I, section 35)to our\n\n        state constitution expanded the category of evidence that is admissible in a death\n\n        sentencing proceeding under Bartholomew II, 101 Wn.2d 631. The court cautioned,\n\n        however,that the trial court must always weigh the probative value ofvictim impact\n\n        evidence against its potential for prejudice, and that it must exclude '\"irrelevant\n\n        information or inflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury's attention jfrom its proper\n\n        role or invites an irrational, purely subjective response.'\" Gentry, 125 Wn.2d at 632\n\n        (quotingPeop/e v.

Id. at 884. In Prince, 40 Cal. 4th at 1291, the court\n\n        approved the use of a 25-minute video interview of the victim by a local television\n\n        station. It distinguished that video, which it described as \"a calm, even static,\n\n        discussion of[the victim's] accomplishments and interests,\" from videos containing\n\n        music or images ofthe victim as an infant or young child. Id. at 1287. And in State\n\n        V. Hess, 207 N.J. 123, 158-59, 23 A.3d 373 (2011), the New Jersey Supreme Court\n\n                                                141\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        held that defense counsel erred by failing to object to the admission of a 17-minute,\n\n        professionally produced video featuring music,images ofthe victim's childhood and\n\n        tombstone, and the superimposed text of poems scrolling over the images.\n\n              In response, the State relies primarily on People v. Kelly, approving the use of\n\n        a 20-minute video, set to background music by Enya, depicting the victim from\n\n        infancy until her death at age 19. 42 Cal. 4th 763, 793-99,68 Cal. Rptr. 3d 531, 171\n\n        P.3d 548(2007). The Kelly decision repeatedly emphasizes the need for trial courts\n\n        to be \"very cautious\" in admitting videotape victim impact evidence, but concludes\n\n        that the video in question was \"not unduly emotional\" and \"was relevant to the\n\n        penalty determination[ because i]t humanized [the victim].\" Id. at 797-99. The\n\n        decision acknowledges that the background music was probably \"irrelevant\" and\n\n        \"emotional,\" and it appears to disapprove of a \"theatric\" image of people on\n\n        horseback at the end of the video, but it concludes that these elements, even if\n\n        erroneously admitted, were harmless. Id. at 798.\n\n              Thus, the case law on victim impact videos, including Kelly, generally\n\n        distinguishes between objective representations (admissible) and stylized\n\n        productions (inflammatory). It also distinguishes between information about the\n\n        victim's life (admissible) and tributes to the victim (inflammatory).\n\n              The memorial video presented in this case contains four basic elements: many\n\n        still images ofthe victims, many moving images ofthe victims, a few captions with\n                                                142\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        phrases like \"you are gone, but not forgotten,\" and a few images of clouds and\n\n        coastlines. It also contains a few images of the two adult victims as children.\n\n              The captions and images of nature are the kind ofstylized elements that courts\n\n        have deemed inflammatory and therefore inadmissible. E.g., Hess, 207 N.J. at 158-\n\n        59; Salazar, 118 S.W.3d at 884. And the images ofthe adult victims as children are\n\n        also problematic. Hess, 207 N.J. at 158-59; Salazar, 118 S.W.3d at 884. But in this\n\n        case, the emotional impact of those fleeting elements is negligible compared with\n\n        the impact ofthe many still and moving images ofthe two child victims. And courts\n\n        applying Payne have held that moving images and video photomontages are\n\n        admissible as victim impact evidence in a capital case. E.g., State v. Gray, 887\n\n        S.W.2d 369, 389(Mo. 1994)(videotape of victim at family's Christmas admissible\n\n        \"to show the victims are individuals whose deaths represent a unique loss to society\n\n        and to their family and that the victims are not simply 'faceless strangers'\"(quoting\n\n        Payne, 501 U.S. at 825)); State v. Leon, 142 Idaho 705, 707, 710, 132 P.3d 462\n\n        (Idaho Ct. App. 2006)(4 1/2-minute DVD (digital video disk) containing video and\n\n        photographic images of victim and victim's children was admissible victim impact\n\n        evidence). But see Sampson, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 191-93 (27-minute video featuring\n\n        200 still photographs of the victim from victim's life, beginning at infancy, would\n\n        have been inadmissible even without evocative musical soundtrack because it\n\n        \"provided much more than a 'quick glimpse' of the victim's life\").\n                                                 143\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              In light of our precedent allowing the State to present victim impact evidence,\n\n        the trial court did not err by admitting the video without sound.\n\n                        2. Victimfamily member testimony\n\n                           a. Preservation of error\n\n              The State argues that we should decline to reach the issue ofthe victim impact\n\n        testimony because Schierman did not object to this testimony at trial. The State\n\n        contends that the defendant is required to preserve such an error under Gregory, 158\n\n        Wn.2dat 853 n.43.\n\n\n              We reject the State's argument and reach the merits of this issue. First, we\n\n        construe procedural rules more liberally in a capital case. Lord I, 117 Wn.2d at 849\n\n        (citing Jeffries, 105 Wn.2d at 418). Second, this court has addressed unpreserved\n\n        challenges to the admission of victim impact evidence in the past. See Gregory, 158\n\n        Wn.2d at 853 n.43 (noting that defendant failed to preserve state, as opposed to\n\n        federal, constitutional challenges to the admission ofvictim impact evidence; stating\n\n        that \"to the extent that we evaluate these arguments, we do so under RAP 2.5(a)'s\n\n        limitations\"; and addressing the state constitutional arguments).\n\n                            b. Merits\n\n               Schierman argues that the victim impact testimony was irrelevant and\n\n        inflammatory under Gentry because it emphasized \"the victims' goodness, beauty,\n\n\n\n                                                 144\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

We decline to adopt a rule that says some victims'\n\n        stories—^particularly those involving religion, immigration, or persecution—are too\n\n        compelling to be admissible.\n\n\n                 Finally, Schierman asserts that the presence of uniformed military personnel in\n        the courtroom, combined with Leonid's testimony that he was stationed in Iraq when the\n        murders occurred,\"rendered the death sentence arbitrary and capricious in violation of the\n        Eighth Amendment and Article 1, § 14.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 84. Schierman cites\n        no authority for this argument. In the portion ofthis opinion that addressed the guilt phase\n        of Schierman's trial, we concluded that the presence of uniformed officers, even in\n        combination with Leonid's testimony, did not render Schierman's trial unfair. We know\n        of no authority suggesting that we should reach a different conclusion under the Eighth\n        Amendment and article I, § 14.\n                                                    146\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              III.   The Trial Court Did Not Violate Schierman's Right to Due Process or\n                     Protection Against Cruel Punishment When It Permitted the State to\n                     Cross-Examine Schierman's Stepfather on the Contents ofSchierman's\n                     Rehabilitation Treatment Journal\n\n              Schierman challenges the trial court's ruling allowing the State to cross-\n\n        examine his stepfather, Dean Dubinsky, about selected passages in a journal\n\n        Schierman kept while undergoing treatment at the Lakeside-Milam. The trial court\n\n        permitted this cross-examination as rebuttal to Dubinsky's testimony that he never\n\n        worried about the possibility that Schierman might harm another person when he\n\n        was intoxicated. Schierman argues that the treatment journal's prejudicial effect\n\n        outweighed its rebuttal value, and that the cross-examination therefore violated the\n\n        constitutional rules adopted in Bartholomew I and II.

Facts\n\n              On April 19, 2010,the first day ofthe penalty phase, the defense asked the\n\n        court to limit the State's cross-examination of mitigation witnesses as follows:\n\n              \"[Wje'd move to exclude cross-examination by the State with respect\n              to ... other bad acts without foundation .... I can give an example.\n\n                     What I'm concerned about is a particular witness gets up,family\n              or friend, indicates that their experience with [Schierman] has been a\n              good one and they find him to have certain characteristics and\n              background, and the State gets up and asks a series of questions like\n                                                147\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

So I'm concerned about.\n              . . the, if you will, do you still beat your wife kind of questions.\n\n        VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 44.\n\n              The State responded that it had \"an abundance of foundation\" to ask about\n\n        prior bad acts,\"from the defendant's own writings and his descriptions to others of\n\n        his past life.\" Id. at 45. The defense disagreed, but only because the State could not\n\n        \"establish foundation as to any personal knowledge by any of these witnesses.\" Id.\n\n        at 46 (emphasis added).\n\n              The court rejected that argument on the ground that the State did not need to\n\n        establish that any mitigation witness was personally aware of an alleged specific\n\n        prior instance of bad or violent conduct. Instead, the court ruled, the State needed\n\n        to establish only that it had a \"good faith basis\" to believe that the prior bad act in\n\n        fact occurred: \"One is not required to assume or know in advance whether the\n\n        witness is aware of the prior bad act, there simply has to be a good faith basis for\n\n        asking about the act itself.\" VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 46-47.\n\n              The defense explained that it was particularly concerned about questioning\n\n        based on a \"treatmentjournal\" that Schierman had kept while he was a patient at the\n\n        Lakeside-Milam, a drug and alcohol addiction treatment facility. Id. at 47. The\n\n        court asked the defense,\"What's the basis for moving to exclude any references to\n\n\n                                                 148\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The defense repeated that the journal\n\n        described incidents about which no mitigation witness had direct, personal\n\n        knowledge. The court again rejected the argument that such knowledge was a\n\n        necessary foundation for questioning witnesses about the contents of the joumal.^^\n\n              The following day, the defense called Schierman's stepfather, Dubinsky, as\n\n        its first mitigation witness. Dubinsky testified that Schierman had emotional\n\n        problems stemming from his childhood, and that this led him to use alcohol and\n\n        drugs. He explained that\"[Schierman] and Kinsey[, Schierman's sister,] came from\n\n        an alcoholic home,\" that Schierman was smart but had low self-esteem, and that\n\n        Schierman had apparently attempted suicide before Dubinsky began dating\n\n        Schierman's mother. VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 49-60. He also testified that\n\n        Schierman was extremely protective of his mother and sister, a characteristic that\n\n        Dubinsky attributed to \"the previous lives with their father.\" Id. at 56.\n\n              Dubinsky described Schierman's last two years of high school as difficult,\n\n        mainly because ofSchierman's depression, which he also attributed to psychological\n\n        abuse by Schierman's father. But he explained that Schierman's outlook improved\n\n\n\n\n                 In his opening brief, Schierman asserted that \"[t]he defense objected to the\n        introduction of information from the journal[,] citing State v. Bartholomew [II].\"\n        Appellant's Opening Br. at 156. But in his reply brief, Schierman concedes that defense\n        counsel did not cite to Bartholomew I and II when objecting to the admission of the\n        treatmentjoumal.\n                                                 149\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

When asked to describe Schierman\n\n        when he graduated from high school, Dubinsky said that \"he was full of promise.\"\n\n       Id. at 65.\n\n\n              Shortly after Schierman enrolled in college, however, his relationship with his\n\n        mother and Dubinsky began to deteriorate and he moved out oftheir home. During\n\n        this period, Schierman lived with his father briefly. By the time Schierman was 23,\n\n        Dubinsky believed that he was drinking excessively on a daily basis. Finally, after\n\n        Schierman showed up at his family's home carrying a gun and threatening suicide,\n\n        he entered a 28-day inpatient treatment program at Lakeside-Milam.\n\n              Dubinsky testified that Schierman responded well to treatment. At the end of\n\n       the 28 days, Schierman moved into a group home for recovering addicts.\n\n              Near the end of Dubinsky's direct examination, defense counsel asked him if\n\n        he ever feared that Schierman would harm another person while he was intoxicated.\n\n        Dubinsky testified that he did not because although he had \"heard .. . maybe one or\n\n        two stories about [Schierman] being in a fight at a bar or something .... He didn't\n\n        have the history of hurting people or hurting things, or doing things that were\n\n        violent.\" Id. at 104(emphasis added). Defense counsel then prompted Dubinsky to\n\n        address the treatment journal, which \"may or may not have described assaultive\n\n        behavior.\" Id. at 105. Dubinsky stated that he had first learned of the journal \"the\n\n        other day,\" and had asked defense counsel to show him a copy of it in preparation\n\n                                                150\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Dubinsky testified that Schierman had never been violent or\n\n        assaultive toward anyone else in Dubinsky's presence.\n\n              On cross-examination, the prosecutor handed Dubinsky a collection of\n\n        photocopied papers, \"marked for identification as State's Exhibit Number 2,\" and\n\n        asked if he recognized them. M at 115. He said he did not. The prosecutor indicated\n\n        that they were excerpts ofthe treatmentjournal and asked Dubinsky if he'd seen the\n\n       journal. Dubinsky explained that he had \"asked the defense attorneys ifI could have\n\n        some information about the journal [and tjhey sent me some excerpts on line.\" Id.\n\n        at 115-16. He clarified that the excerpts were typed, whereas the photocopies he'd\n\n       just been handed were handwritten.\n\n              The prosecutor then questioned Dubinsky about particular passages in the\n\n       journal, referring him to specific numbered pages and asking whether they'd been\n\n        included in the excerpts he'd seen online. In these excerpts, Schierman described\n\n        \"stealing cigarettes and clothes and getting in fights,\" id. at 117-18; being \"a really\n\n        good actor,\" id. at 118-19;\"mak[ing] short work of—as in beating up —^his father,\n\n        id. at 120; inadvertently exposing his pets to the residual cocaine and ecstasy in his\n\n        sweat; and using hallucinogens and \"beating the shit out of a homeless person that\n\n        [he] thought was an alligator,\" id. at 122-23.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        remember seeing the excerpt about stealing cigarettes and clothes, and had not been\n\n        provided the excerpt about cocaine and ecstasy.\n\n              The prosecutor asked Dubinsky whether he'd seen an excerpt in which\n\n        Schierman described putting the back of his father's head through a wall and\n\n        knocking him unconscious. In the excerpt, Schierman stated that he \"gave his\n\n        [father's] right hand a good couple sto[m]ps till I hear bones break,\" and later told\n\n        his father that he'd punched a hole in the wall in a drunken rage. Id. at 124.\n\n        Dubinsky acknowledged that this episode had been included in the journal excerpts\n\n        provided to him. He then stated:\n\n              [Jjust to be upfront with you, I don't recall [Schierman's father] ever\n              having a broken hand and I don't remember ~ he never called to discuss\n              with us about an assault like this that would have taken place. I would\n              have imagined that there would have been some sort of\n              communications, parent to parent, if there was something like this\n              going on.\n\n        Id.\n\n\n              Finally, the prosecutor asked Dubinsky about an excerpt in which Schierman\n\n        stated that he'd had \"several close calls with police, often with handcuffs on, in the\n\n        back of a cruiser, yet I never was arrested.\" Id. at 125. Dubinsky said that the\n\n        excerpt had been provided to him in the defense materials and did not match his\n\n        experience with Schierman: \"I would imagine he would have ended up in jail or we\n\n        would have gotten a phone call or there would be some sort of write-up by the police\n\n\n                                                 152\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

He made similar comments about two more excerpts in\n\n        which Schierman described \"an ass whooping at the hands of a telescoping, steel\n\n        baton . . .

Analysis\n\n                          1. Preservation oferror\n               Schierman acknowledges that the prosecution may rebut testimony by a\n\n        capital defendant's mitigation witness, but he argues that the journal was\n\n        inadmissible because it was more prejudicial than probative. First, he argues that\n\n        the journal was not relevant rebuttal evidence because Dubinsky \"never made\n\n        sweeping statements about Schierman's peacefulness.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at\n\n        166. Second, Schierman argues that the journal was unreliable. The State argues\n\n        that Schierman failed to preserve any such error because he did not cite Bartholomew\n\n        I and II or argue that the journal was more prejudicial than probative when\n\n        challenging its admission in the penalty phase proceeding.\n\n               The State is correct that Schierman neither cited Bartholomew I and II nor\n\n        objected to the journal's admission on the ground that the journal was irrelevant or\n\n        more prejudicial than probative. Instead, he sought to exclude the journal on the\n\n        ground that none of his mitigation witnesses had personal knowledge of the events\n\n\n\n                                                 153\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       (fictional or otherwise) recounted in the journal. Thus, defense counsel did not\n\n        preserve the errors that Schierman now raises.\n\n              Under RAP 2.5(a)(3), this court may decline review of an unpreserved error\n\n        unless the error is both \"manifest\" and \"truly of constitutional dimension.\" O'Hara,\n\n        \\61 Wn.2d at 98. We have said that an error is of constitutional magnitude only if\n\n        it deprives the defendant of an actual constitutional guaranty. Id. at 99, 103\n\n       (contrasting errors of constitutional magnitude, such as jury instructions that shift\n\n        the burden of proof, and errors of nonconstitutional magnitude, such as failure to\n\n        instruct on a lesser included offense). But the limitation on aggravating evidence in\n\n        a capital penalty phase proceeding was established by Bartholomew I and II and was\n\n        clearly based on our state constitution. Thus,the admission of aggravating evidence\n\n        in violation of Bartholomew I and II is an error of constitutional magnitude.^'^\n\n\n\n                To the extent that this holding conflicts with certain statements in Lord I, 117\n        Wn.2d at 895, we disavow Lord I. In that case, this court held that it would not consider\n        an unpreserved challenge to the admission of penalty phase testimony regarding the age of\n        a girl the defendant victimized in a prior offense. Id. It reasoned that the defendant\"does\n        not specify how the age of the victim especially prejudiced him and, thus, was\n        constitutional error.\" Id. (emphasis added). This misstates our precedent on RAP\n        2.5(a)(3). In equating \"prejudice\" with \"constitutional magnitude,\" the Lord I court\n        purported to rely on State v. Scott, 110 Wn.2d 682, 688, 757 P.2d 492(1988). 117 Wn.2d\n        at 895. But Scott does not equate those concepts—on the contrary, it defines errors of\n        \"constitutional magnitude\" just as they are defined in O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at 98-99: as\n        errors that deprive the defendant of a constitutional guaranty. See 110 Wn.2d at 689-91\n        (declining review under RAP 2.5 not because defendant failed to show prejudice, but\n        because alleged error did not violate constitutional guaranty).\n\n                                                   154\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Whether the admission of the treatment journal was \"manifest\" error under\n\n       RAP 2.5(a)(3) is a more difficult question. To prove that an unpreserved error is\n\n        manifest, an appellant must make a '\"plausible showing . . . that the asserted error\n\n        had practical and identifiable consequences in the trial.'\" Kalebaugh, 183 Wn.2d at\n\n        584 (quoting O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at 99). And a practical and identifiable error is\n\n        one that '\"the [trial] court could have corrected,'\" given what it knew at the time.\n\n       Id.(quoting O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at 100).\n\n              In this case, that standard is satisfied as to two of the alleged but unpreserved\n\n        errors regarding the treatment journal—^the ruling that the journal's references to\n\n        specific instances of conduct were relevant rebuttal evidence (under ER 402) and\n\n        the ruling that this evidence was more probative than prejudicial(ER 403). These\n\n        are legal questions, which we can resolve—and the trial court could have\n\n        addressed—by comparing the content of Dubinsky's testimony on direct\n\n        examination with the content of the treatment journal the State sought to use on\n\n        cross-examination. But that standard is not met with respect to the other error that\n\n        Schierman alleges—^the trial court's (implicit) determination that the treatment\n\n       journal was sufficiently reliable for the State to have a good faith basis to use it,\n\n        particularly in the penalty phase proceeding. Because the defense failed to challenge\n\n        the journal as unreliable (or otherwise insufficient to provide the State with a good\n\n        faith base for cross-examination), the record contains no colloquy on this issue. We\n                                                 155\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       cannot now guess what that colloquy would have revealed if it had actually occurred.\n\n       Nor could the trial court have corrected a problem about which it was unaware. We\n\n       therefore address the merits of only the first two issues: relevance and probative\n\n        value versus prejudicial effect.\n\n                        2. We reject Schierman's claim that the specific instances of\n                           conduct described in the treatmentjournal were inadmissible\n              In Lord I, this court held that the scope ofrebuttal evidence in a penalty phase\n\n        proceeding was broad, but still limited by Bartholomew II's balancing of probative\n\n        value against prejudicial effect: \"defense witnesses may be cross-examined\n\n        concerning anything relevant to a matter raised in mitigation by the defendant,\n\n        subject to the balancing test.\" 117 Wn.2d at 889-93,892. The Lordl court explained\n\n        that Bartholomew II's rebuttal rule was \"analogous to the rules of evidence\n\n        concerning testimony about defendant's character\":\n\n                     When a defendant presents evidence of his character, the State\n               may inquire further to determine the reliability of that evidence. A\n               defendant's character witness may be cross-examined about his\n               personal knowledge of specific incidents of misconduct.. . .\n\n                           The scope of cross-examination is sufficiently\n                     broad to make it dangerous for the defendant to call\n                     character witnesses unless the defendant has led a good\n                     life. A character witness may not only be asked whether\n                     he \"has heard\" this or that about the defendant, but he may\n                     also be asked \"Do you know\" this or that about the\n                     defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 156\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        117 Wn.2d at 892-93 (quoting 5 Karl B. Tegland, Washington Practice:\n\n        Evidence Law AND Practice, § 125, at 45 (3ded. 1989)).\n\n              In State v. Brett, 126 Wn.2d 136, 185-89, 892 P.2d 29 (1995), vacated and\n\n        remanded, 142 Wn.2d 868, 16 P.3d 601 (2001), this court reaffirmed the rebuttal\n\n        evidence rule stated in Bartholomew II and Lord I. It held that evidence of the\n\n        defendant's prior uncharged crimes was admissible to rebut a mitigation witness's\n\n        testimony that the defendant'\"respected people'\" and \"was 'a real gentleman'.\" Id.\n\n        at 188. Dubinsky's testimony was similar to that offered in Brett, Dubinsky stated\n\n        that Schierman had no history of hurting people or acting violently, VRP (Apr. 20,\n\n        2010) at 104. Under Lord I, the State could rebut this testimony with specific\n\n        instances of Schierman's conduct, to the extent that the evidence was responsive to\n\n        the assertions about his nonviolent character and more probative than unfairly\n\n        prejudicial. 117 Wn.2d at 892; see generally State v. Kelly, 102 Wn.2d 188, 193-\n\n        94, 685 P.2d 564 (1984)(regarding admission of evidence of accused's character\n\n        under ER 404(a)(1) and cross-examination as to \"specific instances of conduct\" per\n\n        ER 405(a)). The State basically did this. Most of the specific instances of conduct\n\n        that it cited in Schierman's journal were instances of violent or abusive behavior.\n\n        Thus, the State's use of the journal fell within the boundaries of ER 404(a)(1) and\n\n        ER 403 and was not barred by Bartholomew II.\n\n\n\n                                               157\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Finally, Schierman argues that Lord I and Brett are distinguishable because in\n\n        both ofthose cases,the specific instances ofthe defendant's prior conduct addressed\n\n        on cross-examination were \"well known to the defense witness.\" Appellant's Reply\n\n        Br. at 62. (This alleged error is preserved.) This is incorrect. In Brett, 126 Wn.2d\n\n        at 187, the State was permitted to ask a mitigation witness about a prior uncharged\n\n        assault committed by the defendant, even though the witness did not learn of that\n\n        assault until he was subpoenaed. The events described in Schierman's treatment\n\n       journal were no less well known to Dubinsky, who first read excerpts from the\n\n       journal the night before giving his mitigation testimony.\n\n              IV.

The trial court sustained the\n\n        State's objection. It did so by ruling that the defense could not question Dubinsky\n\n        about any passage in the journal that Dubinsky had not previously read—^not by\n\n        ruling that the defense could not inquire into nonresponsive specific instances of\n                                                158\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Facts\n\n\n              On redirect, defense counsel called Dubinsky's attention to a portion of the\n\n       treatment journal labeled page 3379, which was included among the photocopied\n\n       pages marked as State's exhibit 2, and asked if it \"look[ed] like addresses where\n\n       [Schierman was] maybe seeking jobs or doing something like that?\" VRP(Apr. 20,\n\n       2010) at 128. The State objected on grounds of foundation, and the court sustained\n\n       the objection.\n\n              Defense counsel stated that the State had already laid the foundation: \"[The\n\n        prosecutor] has shown you what has been marked as... State's exhibit number two.\"\n\n       Id. at 129. Counsel then asked Dubinsky to read from page 3379. The State again\n\n        objected that it was hearsay without foundation.\n\n              The court sustained the objection: \"[Tjhere was no foundation.

Finally,\n\n        defense counsel asked whether \"the select references that [the prosecutor] has\n\n                                                159\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The court\n\n       sustained the State's objection on grounds of relevance.\n\n                    B. Analysis\n\n              Schierman argues that the defense \"had a right\" at trial \"to introduce more\n\n       positive aspects of [the treatment journal]\" after the State \"cherry pick[ed] those\n\n       [passages] where Schierman described anger or violence.\" Appellant's Opening Br.\n\n       at 168. The State counters that Schierman could have introduced the treatment\n\n\n       journal through other witnesses, but could not simply have Dubinsky \"read for the\n\n       jury portions of a document as to which he has no knowledge.\" Br. ofResp't at 226.\n\n             The State is correct. Dubinsky's testimony on direct examination included\n\n       evidence of Schierman's (the \"accused['s],\" per BR 404(a)(1)) character,\n\n       specifically his character trait of nonviolence while drunk. It was admissible under\n\n       Bartholomew II (even if it had not been admissible under the Rules of Evidence).\n\n       The State's inquiry into specific instances of Schierman's violence on cross-\n\n       examination was permissible to impeach Dubinsky's testimony that Schierman was\n\n       not violent when drinking—it tended both to rebut this testimony and call into\n\n       question Dubinsky's credibility. Thus, it was admissible under BR 405(a) and not\n\n        barred by Bartholomew II.

The Trial Court's Decision To Allow Broad and Irrelevant Cross-\n                      Examination of Christopher O'Brien Was Error, But the Error Was\n                      Harmless\n\n               During the penalty phase, the defense called Schierman's friend Christopher\n\n        O'Brien. He testified that Schierman was friendly, well liked, and serious about his\n\n        addiction recovery. The court then permitted the State to cross examine O'Brien\n\n        about statements he made to detectives investigating the murders. The State asked\n\n        O'Brien whether he relayed incriminating statements that a third party, Mark Nanna,\n\n        made about Schierman. Schierman argues that this line of questioning violates the\n\n        constitutional rules adopted in Bartholomew I and II by introducing aggravating\n\n        evidence that was both irrelevant and hearsay.\n\n\n                  As the trial court suggested, the positive aspects of Schierman's life reflected in\n        the treatment journal might well have been admissible through other witnesses; they\n        constitute aspects of his character that might weigh in favor of a life sentence and might\n        even have been admissible under ER 106 to help complete the jury's understanding of the\n        joumal.

O'Brien testified that he\n\n        met Schierman in late 2000 and that the two became close friends. He testified that\n\n        their relationship became more distant when Schierman began using drugs, but\n\n        improved when Schierman completed treatment. He described Schierman as\n\n        friendly, well liked, and energetic, and stated that Schierman took his treatment and\n\n        recovery seriously and appeared to be doing well when O'Brien last saw him before\n\n        the murders. O'Brien also testified that he still tried to visit Schierman regularly and\n\n        that Schierman always appeared to be in good spirits and happy to see him.\n\n              On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked O'Brien about the arguably\n\n        contradictory statements he had made to detectives following the murders. These\n\n        statements related to Schierman's drinking, the strain it had put on their friendship,\n\n        and Schierman's tendency to be friendly and flirtatious when he drank, but they did\n\n        not touch directly on Schierman's general friendliness, energy, or treatment\n\n        progress. The prosecutor then asked O'Brien whether he remembered calling a\n\n        detective at the Kirkland Police Station and \"telling him that you needed to get\n\n        something off your chest?\" VRP (Apr. 21, 2010) at 82. O'Brien responded that he\n\n        had told the detective he had \"some information that he might be able to use.\" Id.\n\n        He said that he was not \"trying to help either side, but if there was a possibility that\n\n\n\n                                                  162\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

O'Brien answered that he did not remember \"a bucketful\n\n        of knives,\" but had told the detective that a person named Mark Galante (then Mark\n\n        Nanna)had helped Schierman move and might be able to provide some information.\n\n       Id.\n\n\n              The prosecutor asked O'Brien if he remembered telling the detectives about a\n\n        comment Schierman made \"about the quote, hot chick across the street, washing her\n\n        car in a bikini?\" Id. at 84. O'Brien answered that he had told the detectives that\n\n       \"Mark had mentioned something along those lines.\" Id. The prosecutor repeated\n\n        the question two more times, and O'Brien stated that he could not remember his\n\n        exact statement to the detectives. The prosecutor then read the following from a\n\n        Kirkland Police Department detail marked as State's exhibit 4:\n\n              Nanna told O'Brien that Schierman had a bucketful of knives and that\n              he observed Schierman playing with a knife similar to the first knife\n              found at the crime scene, and Nanna also said that Schierman made a\n              comment about the quote, hot chick, unquote, across the street, washing\n              her car in a bikini. O'Brien also provided me with contact numbers for\n              each person on our list for the previous week, including Nanna.\n\n\n\n\n                                                163\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       Id. at 85-86. O'Brien acknowledged that the notes refreshed his memory of the\n\n       statement he had given to the detectives. He said that they reflected \"what[Nanna]\n\n       had told me.\" Id. at 86.\n\n\n                After a briefredirect followed by a recess, the defense moved to strike the last\n\n        question and answer in O'Brien's cross-examination, arguing that Narma's\n\n       statements were hearsay.        The court denied the motion, concluding that the\n\n       statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but instead to\n\n       \"indicate that Mr. O'Brien had heard them from Mr. Nanna, allegedly statements\n\n        made by the defendant, and that, in fact, those statements were then conveyed to the\n\n       police.\" Id. at 89-90. The court found that this was an appropriate subject for cross-\n\n       examination given that O'Brien was called as a character witness for the defense\n\n       who had contacted police with information about Schierman after the murders and\n\n       then \"tr[ied] to be as vague as he could about his recall of [that contact]\" on the\n\n       witness stand. Id. at 89.\n\n\n                The defense then requested a limiting instruction telling the jury that the\n\n       statements were not offered as proof of the matter asserted. The court said that if it\n\n       gave such an instruction, it would also instruct the jury that the statements were\n\n       offered \"to reflect the fact that this witness was testifying that these statements had\n\n       been made by the defendant to this other individual and then conveyed to him.\" Id.\n\n       at 90.\n\n                                                  164\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Id. at 91.\n\n        The court then stated that it would\n\n\n              advise the jury that the . . . testimony Mr. O'Brien related to statements\n              by Mr. Mark Nanna are not admitted for the truth ofthe matters asserted\n              by Mr. Nanna to Mr. O'Brien, they are only admitted for the limited\n              purpose of considering Chris O'Brien's testimony that [Nanna] had\n              made these statements to him.\n\n\n       Id. at 92. The defense agreed to that instruction.\n\n               On April 27, 2010,the defense filed a written motion to strike the portion of\n\n        O'Brien's testimony that addressed Nanna's alleged statements.           The motion\n\n        included a transcript of the defense interview of the detective who interviewed\n\n        Nanna about the statements. The transcript showed that Nanna had denied making\n\n        any statements about a bucket of knives or a hot chick. The defense argued that the\n\n        State lacked a good faith basis for asking about the statements, and that the\n\n        statements were therefore irrelevant and prejudicial.\n\n              The court heard argument on the motion the following day. The State argued\n\n        that it had a good faith basis for asking O'Brien about Nanna's alleged statements,\n\n        because it had determined that Nanna was trying to protect Schierman (and that his\n\n        statements to detectives could therefore not be trusted). The defense argued that\n\n        Nanna's statements were irrelevant because O'Brien did not deny giving any\n\n        information to detectives.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 165\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              The court found that the State had a good faith basis for asking about Nanna's\n\n        statements and denied the motion. It reasoned that the State's \"extensive questioning\n\n        was required because clearly Mr. O'Brien was attempting to deny or minimize the\n\n        information he had earlier provided to detective[s] . . . and when finally confronted\n\n        with that follow-up report,... Mr. O'Brien was backpedaling as fast as he could, in\n\n        the Court's opinion.\" VRP (Apr. 28, 2010) at 22-23.\n\n              The court also ruled that defense counsel could call the detective who\n\n\n        interviewed Nanna, for \"purposes of examining him regarding his . . . attempt[s]. .\n\n        . to verify or refute or follow up on the statements that Mr. O'Brien told him were\n\n        made by Mr. Nanna.\" Id. at 24. The defense ultimately did not call that detective.\n\n                       B. Analysis\n\n              Schierman argues that O'Brien's statements to the police \"had no rebuttal\n\n        value\" because they did not contradict anything O'Brien said on direct examination:\n\n       \"the court suggested that the prosecutor's rebuttal was appropriate because O'Brien\n\n        was reluctant to acknowledge his role in the investigation. But that reasoning is\n\n        circular: it assumes that the prosecutor had a good reason in the first place for\n\n        questioning O'Brien about his dealings with the police.\" Appellant's Opening Br.\n\n        at 177, 180.\n\n              This argument goes much farther than any made in the trial court. At trial,\n\n        defense counsel did not object that O'Brien's contacts with police were irrelevant.\n\n                                                166\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       Instead, defense counsel objected only to the portion of that questioning in which\n\n       the prosecutor actually read from the investigating officers' notes—^the portion that\n\n        quoted the statements attributed to Narma—and did so only on the basis that these\n\n        statements were hearsay. For this reason, we must consider whether to review\n\n        Schierman's unpreserved claim that O'Brien's contacts with police were irrelevant.\n\n              Schierman also argues, as did defense counsel in the trial court, that the\n\n        statements attributed to Nanna were inadmissible hearsay.\n\n              Because we reach the merits of Schierman's first argument—^that O'Brien's\n\n        decision to contact police was not relevant to rebut O'Brien's mitigation\n\n        testimony—and because we agree with Schierman on this issue, we do not decide\n\n        whether Nanna's statements were inadmissible hearsay.\n\n                        1. Relevance ofO'Brien 's decision to contactpolice\n\n                           a. Preservation of error\n\n              The prosecutor began his cross-examination by asking O'Brien whether he\n\n        remembered calling a detective at the Kirkland Police Station and \"telling him that\n\n        you needed to get something off your chest?\" VRP(Apr. 21, 2010)at 82. This line\n\n        of questioning implies the following evidentiary rule: when a witness offers\n\n        mitigating character testimony in a capital sentencing proceeding, that witness's\n\n        decision to furnish the police with information tending to show the defendant's guilt\n\n        is inherently relevant in rebuttal. Defense counsel did not challenge that assumption\n\n                                                167\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No, 84614-6\n\n\n        in the trial court, but Schierman does now.         He argues that it violates the\n\n        constitutional rules adopted in Bartholomew I and II and Lord 1.\n\n              An appellate court may decline to review an unpreserved error unless the error\n\n        is both \"manifest\" and \"truly of constitutional dimension.\" O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at\n\n        98. But the erroneous admission of aggravating penalty phase evidence is always of\n\n       \"constitutional dimension\" if the claim is that it violates Bartholomew I and II. Id.\n\n        We also conclude that relevance of O'Brien's decision to contact police is a question\n\n        of law that the trial court could have addressed on the record before it at the time of\n\n        trial without need for any other evidence, testimony, or other information. We\n\n        therefore reach the merits of Schierman's claim that O'Brien's decision to contact\n\n        police was not relevant rebuttal evidence.\n\n                            b. Merits\n\n              The question presented is whether a capital penalty phase mitigation witness'\n\n        decision to provide the police with incriminating information about the defendant\n\n        rebuts that witness' testimony on the topic of the defendant's friendliness, energy,\n\n        and treatment progress. Our only cases on the scope of mitigation witness cross-\n\n        examination are Lord I and Brett. In those cases, the State was permitted to cross-\n\n        examine mitigation witnesses about the defendant's prior uncharged or juvenile\n\n        offenses. Lord I, 117 Wn.2d at 889; Brett, 126 Wn.2d at 185.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 168\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84|514-6\n\n\n              In Lord I, this court analogized Bartholomew I and IPs limits on mitigation-\n\n        rebuttal to \"the rules ofevidence concerning testimony about defendant's character.\"\n\n        117 Wn.2d at 891-92 (quoting ER 405(a)). Ultimately, Lord I held that testimony\n\n        that the defendant\"fled from police and violated his probation\" was relevant to rebut\n\n        his father's testimony that he was \"a 'good boy'.\" Id. at 893-94. In Brett, the\n\n        prosecution cross-examined mitigation witnesses about the defendant's juvenile\n\n        crimes,including first degree kidnapping and assault. 126 Wn.2d at 187. This court\n\n        approved the cross-examination as \"relevant to rebut . . . mitigation witness[]\n\n        testimony that [the defendant] was not a threatening person and/or that it was\n\n        surprising that he took a person's life.\" Id. at 188. It also held that evidence of prior\n\n        uncharged crimes was relevant to rebut another mitigation witness's testimony that\n\n        the defendant \"'respected people'\" and was \"'a real gentleman'.\" Id.\n\n              This case is distinguishable from Lord I and Brett in that O'Brien did not claim\n\n        that Schierman was a good or trustworthy person. Instead, he claimed only that\n\n        Schierman was well liked, took his addiction treatment seriously, and maintained a\n\n        friendship with O'Brien even after his incarceration. For this reason, questioning\n\n        O'Brien about his decision to contact the police was outside the scope ofpermissible\n\n        cross-examination under Lord I and Brett (applying BR 404 and 405). O'Brien's\n\n        decision to contact police—arguably showing his suspicions about Schierman's\n\n        guilt—does not rebut his testimony that Schierman was well liked, took treatment\n                                                  169\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

We therefore hold that the trial court erred by permitting the State to cross-\n\n        examine O'Brien about his decision to contact detectives. We agree with the State,\n\n        however, that this error alone would not warrant reversal because the jury already\n\n        knew that Schierman owned knives and was attracted to women.\n\n              VI.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n               In a capital sentencing proceeding in Washington, the State may argue the\n\n        virtues of the death penalty.^^ In State v. Davis, this court found no misconduct\n\n        where the prosecutor argued that '\"if our courts of law ... are unwilling to impose\n\n        the ultimate penalty where appropriate, it sows the seeds of anarchy [and] it invites\n\n        the lynch law,'\" and exhorted the jury not to '\"violate the social contract between\n\n        us.'\" 141 Wn.2d 798, 870-73 & n,396, 10 P.3d 977 (2000) {Davis I)(emphasis\n\n        omitted), aff'd, 175 Wn.2d 287,290 P.3d 43(2012){Davis 11).^^ It also approved of\n\n        the prosecutor's argument that\n\n               \"when a society is unwilling to overlook the abhorrent acts ofsomeone\n               like the defendant, and recognize that the death penalty is the only\n               appropriate response, that represents civilized society and we put the\n               focus where it belongs, afailure to impose a death penalty in a case\n               like this, in other words, it cheapens all ofour lives.\"\n\n\n\n                See Finch, 137 Wn.2d at 841 (citing State v.

App. 835, 876 P.2d 458 (1994)).\n\n                  Because the defense did not object to the allegedly improper statements in Davis\n        1, on appeal the defendant bore the burden ofshowing that the prosecutor's statements were\n        \"'so flagrant and ill intentioned that [they] evince[d] an enduring and resulting prejudice\n        that could not have been neutralized by an admonition to the jury.'\" 141 Wn.2d at 872\n        (quoting Gentry, 125 Wn.2d at 640). That heightened standard does not apply in this case\n        because (1) Schierman objected and (2) we have tempered that standard somewhat since\n        Davis I was decided. See Emery, 174 Wn.2d at 762 (where defense failed to object to\n        alleged prosecutorial misconduct, \"[r]eviewing courts should focus less on whether the\n        prosecutor's misconduct was flagrant or ill intentioned and more on whether the resulting\n        prejudice could have been cured\")). But the analysis in Davis I is nevertheless relevant\n        because this court found the statements at issue were not improper and thus did not reach\n        the question of prejudice. 141 Wn.2d at 871-74.\n\n\n\n                                                   175\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Sandoval condemned the State's\n       invocation of religious authority in a capital sentencing phase proceeding because (1) it\n       tainted the jury's deliberations with \"concepts of vengeance\" incompatible with the\n       \"refined approach\" our constitution requires and (2) it tended to diminish the jury's sense\n       of responsibility for its verdict.

Thus, in this case,\n\n        we must evaluate the prosecutor's reference to the Holocaust and September 11 in\n\n        light of the prosecutor's \"total argument, the issues in the case, the evidence\n\n        addressed in the argument,and the instructions given to the jury,\" Brown,132 Wn.2d\n\n        at 561, paying special attention to whether that argument appealed to the \"passion\n\n        or prejudice ofthe jury,\" Id. at 564.\n\n               We hold that, in the context of the prosecutor's total argument, the reference\n\n        to September 11 is not an attempt to analogize Schierman to a political terrorist or\n\n        the murders of the Milkin family to the civilian deaths on September 11, 2001.\n\n        Rather, it seems that the prosecutor invoked September 11 as part of a meditation on\n\n        the meaning ofthe word \"terror.\" VRP(May 3, 2010)at 67-69. He argued that that\n\n        word is used \"almost too casual[ly]\" today, and invited the jury to imagine the \"real\n\n        terror\" that the Milkin family must have felt when they were attacked. Id. at 69. The\n\n        circumstances of the defendant's crime are relevant to the jury's decision at the\n\n        penalty phase in a capital case—indeed, the jury is required to consider them. Rice,\n\n\n\n        falls within this standard may be impermissible if it is unreasonably inflammatory\"); Rice,\n        110 Wn.2d at 606-07 (in special sentencing proceeding, prosecutor may narrate the crime\n        and ask the jurors to imagine the victims' experience, even though such an argument is \"an\n        emotional event\").\n                                                   178\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        110 Wn.2d at 606-08. The prosecutor's reference to September 11 was a segue into\n\n       his description of the victims' suffering. It was not misconduct.\n\n              The Holocaust reference is different. The prosecutor did not just analogize\n\n       the murders ofthe Milkin family to the Nazi murders ofthe victims ofthe Holocaust.\n\n        Instead, the prosecutor quoted from a Holocaust museum plaque about the\n\n        immorality of remaining a \"bystander.\" VRP(May 3, 2010) at 74. The message to\n\n        the jurors was that they had a moral duty to take meaningful affirmative action in\n\n        response to Schierman's holocaust, or else they would suffer the same moral guilt\n\n        as those who stood silent and thereby effectively collaborated during the Nazi\n\n        Holocaust. The prosecutor's implicit message was thus, essentially, that only a\n\n        bystander such as a Nazi sympathizer would vote for life without parole instead of\n\n        the death penalty.\n\n              That was,to say the least, an argument that appealed to passion and prejudice.\n\n        Other courts overwhelmingly disapprove of a prosecutor's Holocaust analogy in\n\n        closing argument—although we find no case in which a court has reversed a\n\n        conviction or death sentence because a prosecutor employed that tactic.

Statutory Review\n\n               Washington's death penalty statute requires this court to consider four\n\n        questions when reviewing a sentence of death:\n\n                  (a)Whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the affirmative\n               finding to the question posted by RCW 10.95.060(4);'^^'^^ and\n                  (b)Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to\n               the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and\n               the defendant...;[and]\n                  (c)Whether the sentence of death was brought about through\n               passion or prejudice; and\n                  (d)Whether the defendant had an intellectual disability within the\n               meaning of RCW 10.95.030(2).\n\n        RCW 10.95.130(2).\n\n               Schierman does not argue that the evidence was insufficient to support the\n\n        jury's finding under RCW 10.95.060(4) or that he has an \"intellectual disability\"\n\n        within the meaning of RCW 10.95.030(2)(d). He does argue that his sentence was\n\n        disproportionate and that it resulted from passion or prejudice.\n\n               Schierman contends that his death sentence is disproportionate because the\n\n        death penalty is meted out randomly in Washington, where, for example, Gary\n\n        Ridgway was convicted of killing 48 people but received only a life sentence while\n\n        Schierman, who killed far fewer people, was sentenced to death. He acknowledges\n\n\n\n                  Under RCW 10.95.060(4), the jury must \"retire to deliberate upon the following\n        question:'Having in mind the crime of which the defendant has been found guilty, are you\n        convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances\n        to merit leniency?'\"\n                                                   183\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       that this court rejected that argument in Davis II, 175 Wn.2d 287, and Cross, 156\n\n        Wn.2d at 630, but he argues that those cases were wrongly decided. For the reasons\n\n        given below, I agree.\n\n                     A. Washington's      proportionality     review    statute    (RCW\n                        10.95.130(2)(b)) is a prophylactic measure designed to prevent the\n                        constitutional violations recognized in Furman v. Georgia^^\n\n              Washington's death penalty statute requires this court to determine \"[wjhether\n\n        the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in\n\n        similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\"                    RCW\n\n        10.95.130(2)(b).'''' If the court answers yes to that question, the sentence must be\n\n        invalidated. RCW 10.95.140(l)(b). When this court conducts a proportionality\n\n        review, it considers the penalties imposed in all cases of aggravated first degree\n\n        murder, regardless of whether the prosecutor pursued the death penalty or whether\n\n        the fact-finder ultimately imposed it. This court has described this review as\n\n        comparing the case at bar to all \"death eligible cases.\" Cross, 156 Wn.2d at 630.\n\n\n\n\n             \"408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972).\n\n                The statute defines \"similar cases\" as \"cases reported in the Washington Reports\n        or Washington Appellate Reports since January 1, 1965, in which the judge or jury\n        considered the imposition of capital punishment regardless of whether it was imposed or\n        executed, and cases in which reports have been filed with the supreme court under RCW\n        10.95.120.\" RCW 10.95.130(2)(b). In turn, RCW 10.95.120 requires trial judges to\n        submit reports with information on the defendant, the victim, and the crime in all cases\n        where the defendant is convicted of aggravated first degree murder.\n                                                  184\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Our legislature enacted ROW 10.95.130(2)(b)in response to the United States\n\n        Supreme Court's decision in Furman, 408 U.S. 238, which prohibited sentencing\n\n        procedures that create a substantial risk that death will be imposed in an arbitrary\n\n        and capricious manner. State v. Harris, 106 Wn.2d 784,798, 725 P.2d 975 (1986).\n\n        Furman and its progeny do not require a proportionality review in death penalty\n\n        cases,Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S.764,779,110 S. Ct. 3092,111 L. Ed. 2d 606(1990),\n\n        but they do require proportionality in sentencing.             Thus, Washington's\n\n        proportionality review statute serves a prophylactic purpose: to prevent the death\n\n        penalty from being imposed \"'wantonly and freakishly,\"'Harris, 106 Wn.2d at 798\n\n        (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting Moore v.

The statute is intended to carry out the Furman Court's directive, see id.,\n\n        but it also goes farther than Furman.\n\n                     B. In four decades, this court has never applied a consistent standard\n                        for proportionality under RCW 10.95.130(2)(b)\n\n              In Harris, one ofthe earliest cases applying RCW 10.95.130(2)(b), this court\n\n        acknowledged that the statute's plain language \"provides little guidance to determine\n\n        at what point a death sentence becomes proportionate or disproportionate.\" Id. But\n\n        the Harris court noted that in Georgia, a state with an identical proportionality\n\n        review statute, \"the test for proportionality is whether death sentences have been\n\n\n                                                185\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

The Georgia Supreme Court case on which Morrw relied contrasted\n\n        a sentence imposed \"'generally'\" with a sentence imposed '\"wantonly and\n\n        freakishly'\":\n\n               \"This court is not required to determine that less than a death sentence\n               was never imposed in a case with some similar characteristics.

Rupe, 108 Wn.2d\n\n        734, 767, 743 P.2d 210(1987)(\"a death sentence must not be affirmed where death\n\n        sentences have not generally been imposed in similar cases\"), and Rice, 110 Wn.2d\n\n        at 625 (\"[ojccasional aberrational outcomes do not require a reversal... so long as\n\n\n                  After approving of the Georgia standard, the Harris court employed a very brief\n        proportionality analysis. It first noted the difficulty ofdetermining what subset of all death-\n        eligible murders are comparable to a given defendant's, for purposes of proportionality\n        review. 106 Wn.2d at 798 (citing Jeffries, 105 Wn.2d at 431 (Utter, J., dissenting)). It\n        then compared the murder at bar—a contract killing—to other contract killings prosecuted\n        in Washington since 1981. Id. at 798-99. Of these, there were three where in each case\n        the prosecutor declined to pursue the death penalty. Id. Nevertheless, the Harris court\n        found that the death penalty had not been imposed on Harris \"wantonly and freakishly\" for\n        three reasons:(1) because in one of the other contract killing cases, the trial judge \"said if\n        the State had requested the death penalty it would have gotten it,\"(2) because Harris had\n        participated in the killing he solicited, and(3) because Harris had received a fair trial, had\n        a prior conviction for manslaughter, and had intended to kill multiple victims. Id. at 799.\n                                                     186\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       the death sentence has been imposed generally in similar cases\"). But it did not\n\n        clearly articulate any standard for determining when a death sentence had been\n\n       \"generally\" imposed in similar cases.\n\n              In Rupe, this court began by noting that there had been eight death eligible\n\n        cases in Washington, including Rupe's, in which the jury found \"two of the [three]\n\n        aggravating factors found in [Rupe's] case.\" 108 Wn.2d at 768. Because death\n\n        sentences were imposed in four of these cases, this court concluded that Rupe's\n\n        sentence was not disproportionate in light ofhis offense. Id. at 769-70. This analysis\n\n        suggests a statistical approach in which this court asks whether a death sentence has\n\n        been imposed in some critical mass of cases possessing a certain characteristic (in\n\n        Rupe,the same set of aggravating circumstances).\n\n              But the rest of the Rupe analysis rejects a statistical approach. After\n\n        evaluating Rupe's crime in tenns ofaggravating circumstances,the court considered\n\n        Rupe's personal characteristics. It acknowledged that his respect in the community\n\n        and lack of a criminal record made him unusual among death eligible defendants,\n\n        most of whom had extensive criminal histories. Id. at 770. But it did not then\n\n        undertake the kind of statistical analysis it had applied with respect to the\n\n        aggravating factors. Instead, it held that \"[sjimply because the majority of those\n\n        eligible for the death sentence under our statutes have criminal backgrounds, or\n\n        backgrounds marred by other conditions, does not mean that one who has a\n                                                 187\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        background like Rupe's is thereby ineligible for the death sentence.\" Id. After\n\n        observing that Rupe had committed \"exceedingly cold-blooded, calculated\n\n        murders,\" that \"nothing about Rupe or his background ... excuse[s] him from facing\n\n        the consequences of his actions,\" and that Rupe had received a fair trial, the court\n\n        affirmed the death sentence. Id.\n\n\n              A year later, in Rice, this court began its proportionality review by noting that\n\n       \"[o]f all the comparison cases, only [Rupe's] case involved the same three\n\n        aggravating factors\" as Rice's. 110 Wn.2d at 625-26. This weighed heavily in the\n\n        court's analysis since the court had upheld Rupe's death sentence largely on the basis\n\n        of aggravating factors. Id. at 626. The court also observed that \"Rice's crime is ...\n\n        similar in nature to those committed in two other cases recently before this court in\n\n        which we affirmed death sentences.\" Id. By \"similar in nature,\" the court appeared\n\n        to refer to the fact that, like Rice, the defendants in these cases killed at least one\n\n        victim in order to cover up other murders. Id. As in Rupe,the court noted that Rice's\n\n        personal characteristics were primarily mitigating: Rice had mental illness and no\n\n        criminal history. Id. at 626-27. Nevertheless, this court held that under Rupe,\"[a]\n\n        lack of prior criminal history does not by itself render a death sentence\n\n        disproportionate.\" Id. at 627. And it held that Rice's mental illness did not render\n\n        his death sentence disproportionate because even though the death penalty was not\n\n        imposed in any of the four other death eligible cases in which \"there [was] credible\n                                                 188\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Justice Utter wrote a dissent championing the\n\n        kind of statistical analysis exemplified by the Rupe court's treatment of aggravating\n\n        circumstances. Lord I, 117 Wn.2d at 939-45. Justice Utter argued that a death\n\n       \"sentence is excessive and disproportionate if it has not 'generally been imposed in\n\n        similar cases,\"' and maintained that \"[a] sentence is not 'generally' imposed unless\n\n        it is imposed in at least 50 percent ofthe similar cases.\" Id.\n\n              The Lord I majority rejected that analysis, reasoning that disproportionality\n\n        review is not concerned \"with . . . [tjechnical inconsistencies in a line-by-line\n\n        comparison :\n\n\n              Indeed, the jury is directed to tailor its decision to the individual\n              circumstances of the crime. A jury could decline to impose the death\n              penalty because a particular defendant deserves mercy. However, the\n              decision to afford one defendant mercy, and yet not another, does not\n              violate the constitution.\n\n\n        117 Wn.2dat910.\n\n\n              Because one can never predict when a jury will show mercy, the Lord I\n\n        majority concluded that \"[rjequiring precise unifonnity [of punishment] . . . would\n\n        effectively eliminate the death penalty.\" Id. The majority then went on to apply a\n\n        proportionality analysis that can best be summarized as follows: a death sentence is\n                                                 189\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

Cross, 156 Wn.2d at 631-34(death sentence proportionate where at\n\n        least one victim consciously suffered, aggravating circumstances weighed neither\n\n        for nor against a finding of proportionality, the defendant lacked a significant\n\n        criminal history, and the defendant's personal history \"contain[ed] elements that\n\n        both tend to support the jury's verdict and argue in favor of mercy\").\n\n              Second, a death sentence is not disproportionate simply because it is imposed\n\n        on a defendant with serious mental illness and no significant criminal history.

That\n\n        argument split this court 5 to 4.

The Cross dissent would have held that Washington's\n\n        death penalty violated the proportionality imperative because \"the penalty of death\n\n        is not imposed generally in similar cases\" and is instead \"like lightning, randomly\n\n        striking some defendants and not others.\" Id. at 652.\n\n               The Cross majority rejected this argument, concluding that a prosecutor's\n\n        decision to extend a plea deal in exchange for information is \"highly rational\" and\n\n        upholding Cross's death sentence because he showed a marked level of cruelty to\n\n        his victims. 156 Wn.2d at 622, 631-34.

The dissent analyzed dozens of death eligible\n\n        cases comparable to Davis' and concluded that, with respect to every single\n\n        comparability factor, the vast majority of defendants received sentences of life\n                                                 197\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The Davis II majority affirmed the death sentence\n\n        because it found plausible explanations for several ofthese sentences—explanations\n\n        like the defendant's youth or diminished capacity, the prosecution's lack of direct\n\n        evidence, the presence of a single juror who was adamantly opposed to the death\n\n        penalty, or the prosecutor's disqualification for an overlooked conflict. Id. at 357-\n\n       60. But, as the dissent noted, this ignored RCW 10.95.130(2)(b)'s requirement that\n\n        we affirm a death sentence only if that sentence is generally \"imposed in similar\n\n        cases :\n\n\n\n                     The majority suggests that our death penalty system is\n              proportional because death and life sentences can be explained by\n              factors beyond the crime and the defendant, such as the strength of the\n              State's case, the wishes of the victim's family, or facts known to the\n              defendant about other, unsolved cases. In concluding that these factors\n              make the death penalty proportional, the majority again ignores the\n              language of RCW 10.95.130(2)(b), mistaking the question of whether\n              a sentence is appropriate in an individual case for whether the sentence\n              is generally imposed in similar cases. But the statute requires us to\n              analyze the death penalty, a punishment unique in its severity and\n              irrevocability, on a system-wide level.\n\n                     When one takes the broad, statutorily directed perspective,\n              factors that appear rational at an individual level become irrational. ..\n              .

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Schierman argues that a majority ofthis court should adopt the \"well-reasoned\n\n       dissents\" in Davis II and Cross. Appellant's Opening Br. at 201. I agree. This\n\n       court's approach to proportionality review no longer comports with our legislature's\n\n       protective intent in enacting ROW 10.95.130(2)(b).\n\n              The history of proportionality review demonstrates that we have no single\n\n       clear interpretation of ROW 10.95.130(2)(b). Instead, for the past 35 years we have\n\n        applied continually shifting interpretations—interpretations that allowed us to keep\n\n        affirming death sentences even as they grew more and more statistically rare. When\n\n        questions arose about the proper interpretation ofthe proportionality review statute,\n\n        we consistently resolved those questions in favor ofthe State. See Cross, 156 Wn.2d\n\n        at 636-37 (acknowledging uncertainty over whether the legislature intended this\n\n        court to include in the comparison database death penalty sentences later reversed,\n\n        but resolving that \"doubt\" adversely to the defendant); Lord I, 117 Wn.2d at 909-10\n\n       (acknowledging that RCW 10.95.130(2)(b)\"'provides little guidance to determine\n\n        at what point a death sentence becomes . . . disproportionate,\"' but rejecting Justice\n\n        fitter's standard because \"it would effectively eliminate the death penalty\"(quoting\n\n        Harris, 106 Wn.2d at 798)).\n\n              In the end, given how rarely death sentences were actually sought or imposed\n\n        in these cases, we could find those sentences proportionate only by ignoring most or\n\n        all of the comparability factors in our analysis. E.g., Davis II, 175 Wn.2d at 354-55\n                                                 199\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       (finding death sentence proportionate even though, with respect to every\n\n       comparability factor, the number of life sentences imposed vastly exceeded the\n\n       number of death sentences imposed); Cross, 156 Wn.2d at 631-34 (affirming death\n\n       sentence even though (1)\"the death penalty has not been sought in cases at least as\n\n       brutal,\" (2) the single aggravating circumstance of multiple victims as part of a\n\n       common scheme or plan does not weigh either for or against finding of\n\n       proportionality, (3) the defendant had minimal criminal history, and (4) the\n\n       defendant suffered childhood abuse and had diagnosed personality disorders). And\n\n       that is exactly what we would need to do again, to affirm the death penalty in this\n\n       case since, for purposes of the proportionality analysis, Schierman's case is similar\n\n       to Cross\n\n\n             I agree with Schierman that this precedent is incon-ect: it fails to fulfill ROW\n\n       10.95.130(2)(b)'s prophylactic purpose and it interprets an ambiguous penal statute\n\n       in favor of the State, rather than the defendant. I also agree that it is harmful: it\n\n       results in the disproportionate imposition of the death penalty.

It may be difficult to imagine a case\n\n        in which a death sentence would survive a properly conducted proportionality\n\n        review, but that hypothetical question is not before us.

See State v. Russell, 183 Wn.2d 720, 732, 357 P.3d 38 (2015).\n\n        However,the logic prong uses a categorical, forward-looking approach that\n\n        considers the purposes ofthe public trial right in order to determine whether the\n\n        type of proceeding at issue implicates the public trial right. Id. at 730. The test for\n\n        de minimis closure, meanwhile, uses a case-by-case, backward-looking approach\n\n        that assumes the public trial right is implicated by the proceeding, and then asks\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

Peterson, 85 F.3d at 42.\n\n               The de minimis test thus does not degrade the public trial right or encourage\n\n       closed proceedings because it can never exempt an entire category of proceedings\n\n       from the presumption that all proceedings must occur in open court. It is merely\n\n        an analytical tool applied on review that will always depend on the particular\n\n        circumstances presented. This must be so because no two trials are identical and\n\n        no trial is perfect. \"[A] trial is a uniquely human affair and can be only as flawless\n\n        as the judges and lawyers who conduct it.

In this case, the closure of discussions regarding for-cause challenges\n                       was de minimis\n\n\n               As stated above, the test for whether an unjustified courtroom closure is de\n\n        minimis is whether, in light ofthe specific facts appearing in the record, the\n\n        closure actually undermined the purposes of the public trial right.^ Peterson, 85\n\n        F.3d at 43. These purposes are well established:'\"to ensure a fair trial, to remind\n\n        the prosecutor and judge oftheir responsibility to the accused and the importance\n\n\n\n                 ^ To reiterate, this is a different inquiry from that presented hy the logic prong ofthe\n        experience and logic test. It is already established that for-cause challenges implicate the public\n        trial right generally. State v. Love, 183 Wn.2d 598, 605, 354 P.3d 841 (2015).

In making this\n\n        determination, courts may look to the length of time the courtroom was closed, the\n\n        reason the courtroom was closed, whether the public actually learned what\n\n        occurred during the closed proceeding, and whether the closed proceedings related\n\n       to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence. See Ivester, 316 F.3d at 960; Braun,\n\n       227 F.3d at 919; Peterson, 85 F.3d at 43-44. However, no single factor is either\n\n        necessary or sufficient. \"[T]he methodology employed by the trial court must be\n\n       the focal point of appellate review.\" Braun, 227 F.3d at 918.\n\n               Here, the only proceedings relating to for-cause challenges that occurred in\n\n        chambers were brief arguments by the parties(many of which had already been\n\n        made in open court the day before) and the court announcing its decisions(which\n\n        were repeated in open court immediately afterward).

VRP (Jan, 12,\n\n       2010) at 16 (estimating the in-chambers proceedings would take \"less than ten\n\n       minutes\"). And while the closure was not inadvertent, the court here clearly had\n\n       no intention of shielding either counsels' arguments or its own decisions from\n\n       public scrutiny—a complete record of the proceedings was contemporaneously\n\n       transcribed by a court reporter and is publicly available. Id. This served to remind\n\n       the participants of their functions and responsibilities at the time, and to affirm the\n\n       legitimacy of the proceedings going forward.\n\n               Courtroom closures not justified by di Bone-Club analysis are never\n\n       advisable, but that does not mean they are always structural error requiring\n\n       automatic reversal either. In this case, the closure was de minimis and did not\n\n        violate the public trial right. Therefore, in accordance with the lead opinion,\n\n        Schierman's convictions are affirmed.\n\n\n       B.

Proffered testimony by Dr. Cunningham\n\n               Schierman claims that his sentence should be reversed because the trial court\n\n       limited a belatedly disclosed expansion of expert testimony from Dr. Cunningham,\n\n       a proposed defense witness who was ultimately never called to testify.\n\n        Schierman's argument mischaracterizes the record and draws erroneous\n\n        conclusions from the effect ofthe trial court ruling. The trial court did not err.\n\n               It must be recognized at the outset what trial court decision we are\n\n       reviewing. Well before trial, Dr. Cunningham was properly disclosed as a\n\n        potential mitigation witness. The disclosure indicated that his testimony would be\n\n       \"concordant with his interviews of[Schierman] in so far as they relate to Alcoholic\n\n        Blackout/Propensity/History.\" Clerk's Papers(CP)at 26403. At the completion of\n\n       the guilt phase, the defense filed a supplemental disclosure, again specifying Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's testimony would \"relate to alcoholic blackout.\" Id. at 26424.\n\n        However, in opening statements for the penalty phase, defense counsel stated for\n\n       the first time that Dr. Cunningham would \"testify with respect to what type of\n\n        criminal behavior is predictive of an inmate's prison behavior\" and would include\n\n        testimony related to future prison behavior.

Schierman, No. 84614-6\n       (Yu, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n        grounds: violation ofthe court's discovery orders and relevance. The trial court\n\n        denied the State's motion and allowed the proposed expansion of the testimony,\n\n        subject to a relevancy determination. Schierman is thus seeking reversal based on\n\n        a trial court ruling that was largely in his favor.\n\n               Worth noting is that the trial court would have been justified in excluding all\n\n        of the expanded testimony based on defense counsel's \"blatant and intentional\"\n\n        violation of the court's discovery orders. VRP(Apr. 20, 2010) at 16. Defense\n\n        counsel never provided an adequate explanation for its failure to timely disclose\n\n        the full intended scope of Dr. Cunningham's proposed testimony, and the court\n\n        observed that the only apparent explanation for the defense's \"incredibly untimely\n\n        disclosure,\" id., was \"for tactical reasons,\" id. at 15. However, the trial court\n\n        ultimately ruled that it would allow the expanded testimony from Dr. Cunningham\n\n        regarding future dangerousness, including testimony and opinion about\n\n        Schierman's development as a child and adolescent, his addictions, his alcohol\n\n        treatment and recovery, and his institutional adjustment in jail, to the extent they\n\n        were relevant.

Also, Eldon Vail, former secretary ofthe\n        Department of Corrections, testified extensively for the defense specific to the prison security\n        Schierman would face if incarcerated.\n\n\n                                                        12\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman, No. 84614-6\n       (Yu, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n\n               Nevertheless, Schierman argues that the trial court erred in limiting part of\n\n        Dr. Cunningham's proposed testimony by basing its decision on Morva v.\n\n        Commonwealth, 278 Va. 329, 683 S.E.2d 553 (2009). This argument is simply\n\n        wrong. Morva would have directed the trial court here to exclude Dr.\n\n        Curmingham's expanded testimony entirely, and that is not what happened here.\n\n               In Morva, the Virginia Supreme Court upheld the trial court's exclusion of\n\n        all of Dr. Cunningham's testimony, including the risk assessment specific to the\n\n        defendant and the Virginia prison system. The court concluded:\n\n               It is true that, in this case, unlike Porter [v. Commonwealth, 276 Va.\n               203, 661 S.E.2d 415 (2008)], Dr. Cunningham proposed to provide\n               testimony that concerns Morva's history and background, prior\n               behavior while incarcerated, age and educational attainment, and such\n               factors might bear on his adjustment to prison. However, other\n               testimony Dr. Cunningham proposed to give, and to rely upon in\n               giving a prison risk assessment for Morva, such as potential security\n               interventions that \"could be brought to bear\" upon Morva, and the\n               rates of assaults in the Virginia Department of Corrections, is, by\n               statute, not relevant to the determination the jury has to make\n               concerning Morva's future dangerousness and therefore would not be\n               admissible evidence.\n\n\n        Morva, 278 Va. at 350. Based on this holding, the argument that the trial court\n\n        here applied Morva's analysis is not supportable. While the State cited Morva in\n\n        support of its motion to exclude all of Dr. Cunningham's late-disclosed testimony,\n\n        the trial court denied total exclusion, allowing Dr. Cunningham's relevant\n\n\n\n\n                                                        13\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

That decision was not error. Our statute\n\n       focuses the relevancy inquiry under ROW 10.95.070(8), where the jury is directed\n\n       to consider \"[wjhether there is a likelihood that the defendant will pose a danger to\n\n        others in the future.\" (Emphasis added.) The focus ofthe allowable evidence thus\n\n        plainly centers on the defendant and his circumstances.

The trial court thus did not make an\n\n        unqualified medical judgment about the necessary level of severity for prior head\n\n       injuries—Dr. Adler, a licensed medical doctor, provided that information.\n\n               However, the trial court correctly concluded that there was no factual\n\n        evidence that Schierman had a history of multiple head trauma with loss of\n\n        consciousness and post-injury amnesia. The foundation for Dr. McClung's\n\n        proposed testimony depended on such a history.\n\n               Even as applied to proffered mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of a\n\n        capital case,\"the trial court maintains its traditional authority 'to exclude, as\n\n        irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant's character, prior record, or the\n\n        circumstances of his offense.'\" State v.

The trial court therefore did\n\n        not err in excluding Dr. McClung's testimony due to its inadequate foundation.\n\n               3.      Statutory capital sentence review\n\n               Because the trial court did not err in its evidentiary rulings, Schierman's\n\n       sentence should be affirmed if it passes a statutory capital sentence review, which\n\n        requires the court to address four issues:\n\n                      (a) Whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the\n               affirmative finding to the question posed by ROW 10.95.060(4);^^^ and\n\n                    (b) Whether the sentence of death is excessive or\n              disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering\n              both the crime and the defendant. For the purposes of this subsection,\n              \"similar cases\" means cases reported in the Washington Reports or\n              Washington Appellate Reports since January 1, 1965, in which the\n              judge or jury considered the imposition of capital punishment\n              regardless of whether it was imposed or executed, and cases in which\n              reports have been filed with the supreme court under RCW 10.95.120;\n\n\n               ^ It only \"might\" be properly considered because Dr. McClung was also unable to reach\n        any conclusion about whether any prior head injuries Schierman may have suffered actually had\n        any impact on his behavior or mental processes. See CP at 8259-60.\n               ^ RCW 10.95.060(4) provides,\"Upon conclusion of the evidence and argument at the\n       special sentencing proceeding, the jury shall retire to deliberate upon the following question:\n       'Having in mind the crime of which the defendant has been found guilty, are you convinced\n       beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit\n        leniency?'\"\n\n\n                                                        19\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

As correctly noted by the lead opinion, the arguments in this\n\n       case focus on the second and third issues, which are whether Schierman's sentence\n\n        is disproportionate or was brought about through passion and prejudice. Lead\n\n        opinion at 182.\n\n               Schierman does little to highlight specific facts about himself, his crimes, or\n\n        comparable cases indicating that \"the sentence of death is excessive or\n\n        disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the\n\n        crime and the defendant.\" RCW 10.95.130(2)(b). Instead, he argues, and the lead\n\n        opinion agrees, that \"Washington's death penalty is imposed in a wanton and\n\n       freakish manner,\" such that every capital sentence in Washington should be found\n\n        statutorily disproportionate. Appellant's Opening Br. at 198; see lead opinion at\n\n        181-200. However, as Schierman recognizes, this court has already rejected that\n\n        argument, and he provides no new information or argument that could justify\n\n\n\n\n                                                        20\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

Cross, 156 Wn.2d 580, 630, 132 P.3d 80(2006)\n\n       {emphasis added). To do this,\"we must consider at least(1)the nature ofthe\n\n       crime,(2)the aggravating circumstances,(3)the defendant's criminal history, and\n\n       (4)the defendant's personal history, as well as any additional substantive\n\n        challenges to the proportionality of the sentence.\" Davis, 175 Wn.2d at 348.\n\n               The nature of Schierman's crimes was indisputably horrific. At a time when\n\n        he knew that Olga Milkin's husband was deployed overseas, Schierman entered\n\n        her home and killed her along with her two sons, who were three and five years\n\n        old, and her sister, who was a college student. Olga Milkin and her sister were\n\n        stripped oftheir clothing and stabbed repeatedly in the head and neck. Both were\n\n        stabbed in the neck from the front with such force that the knife actually damaged\n\n\n                This court has shown it is firmly committed to carefully considering new information\n       regarding the constitutionality of capital punishment. See Order, State v. Gregory, No. 88086-7\n       (Wash. Nov. 21,2017). That issue is simply not presented here. Schierman does not provide any\n       new information or any new arguments, and the relevant portions of his briefing do not engage in any\n       meaningful analysis of any constitutional provisions. See Appellant's Opening Br. at 197-202;\n        Appellant's Reply Br. at 72-75.\n                '' Schierman is white, and there is no indication that race or any other suspect\n        classification was implicated at any point in these proceedings.\n\n                                                        21\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

One of the\n\n        children was stabbed through the throat from one side to the other, and the other\n\n        child's throat was cut so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. When Schierman\n\n        woke up in the Milkins' home and found himself covered in blood with four dead\n\n        bodies, he took a shower, changed his clothes, and attempted to bum the house\n\n        down in order to destroy the evidence. The nature ofthese crimes is at least as\n\n        brutal as others in which we have upheld a capital sentence. See id. at 349-51.\n\n               The only aggravating factor submitted to the jury was that \"[tjhere was more\n\n       than one victim and the murders were part of a common scheme or plan.\" RCW\n\n        10.95.020(10). However,\"[t]he nature ofthe aggravating circumstances, as well\n\n        as the number, is important to consider.\" Davis, 175 Wn.2d at 351. As applied to\n\n       the particular facts presented, the nature ofthis aggravating circumstance goes\n\n        beyond the minimal statutory requirements—Schierman's crimes ended the lives\n\n        of a young mother and her two small children while their father was deployed\n\n        overseas, as well as the children's aunt who was there to help while their father\n\n        was gone. He literally destroyed the Milkin family and their home.\n\n               Schierman's lack of prior convictions and difficult personal history neither\n\n        require nor prevent a finding of disproportionality.

See id. at 3-5; Peterson v.\n\n        Williams, 85 F.3d 39,42(2d Cir.), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 878 (1996). The apparent\n\n        distinction is that a prejudice analysis considers the defendant's ultimate guilt or\n\n        innocence, while a triviality analysis considers only whether the defendant was\n\n        deprived of the protections conferred by the public trial right. Concurrence at 3-5.\n\n        This distinction is semantic at best. While it is true that the triviality doctrine does\n\n        not invoke that aspect of harmless error review that considers trial error harmless in\n\n        the face of overwhelming untainted evidence of guilt, that is not the sum total of\n\n        harmlessness review. Fully understood, such review necessarily asks whether the\n\n        defendant suffered a cognizable harm from deprivation ofthe constitutional right at\n\n        issue. As one commentator has aptly observed, requiring defendants to demonstrate\n\n        that a closure tangibly subverted the-core values of the public trial right amounts to\n\n        a harmless error review that is inconsistent with controlling Sixth Amendment\n\n        precedent:\n\n                      The triviality doctrine also approaches harmless error analysis,\n               requiring more of defendants than Waller and Presley allow. . . . Although\n               these courts [that embrace the de minimis standard] have been careful to\n               distinguish this standard from harmless error analysis, the test still demands\n               much more of defendants than the Supreme Court has deemed reasonable\n               when dealing with the intangible benefits of structural error rights. A\n               defendant in a triviality jurisdiction does not have to show a reasonable\n               possibility that the outcome of the trial would have been different (i.e.,\n               prejudice), but he does have to show some kind ofspecific injury manifested\n\n\n                                                     -7-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

If\n               he cannot, then the closure was trivial—^in other words, harmless.

See concurrence at 6-7. That the seemingly unworthy, as well as the worthy,\n\n        may reap the benefit of the law is no reason to find it harmful. Moreover, Justice\n\n        Yu adheres to precedent classifying public trial violations as structural error, even\n\n        when an unlawful closure might not render a trial fundamentally unfair.

Gibbons v. Savage, 555 F.3d 112, 121 (2d\n\n        Cir. 2009) (holding closed portion of voir dire violated Sixth Amendment but\n\n        refusing to reverse based on triviality doctrine because \"nothing of significance\n\n        happened during the part of the session that took place in the courtroom\")\"^. The\n\n        surest way to incentivize trial courts to sedulously protect public trial rights is to\n\n        make it count when they fall short. See Saetveit, supra, at 931 (\"Appellate courts\n\n        are bending over backwards to avoid reversal, when, in actuality, retrials would\n\n        encourage more consistent application of Waller's test at the trial level. That,in turn,\n\n        would reduce the frequency of these appeals and reversals, as trial judges would\n\n        more often avoid violating the right in the first place. A fuller conception of Waller's\n\n\n\n\n                The Second Circuit was the first to embrace the triviality or de minimis exception.\n        See Peterson, 85 F.3d 39. In Gibbons, the court concluded that nothing of significance\n        happened during an aftemoon of voir dire in which the public, including the defendant's\n        mother, were excluded from the courtroom, in part because individual jurors were being\n        questioned privately in a room adjacent to the courtroom during that time. Id. at 114, 121.\n        Of course, under subsequent case law, the private questioning ofjurors outside the open\n        courtroom, in the absence of a demonstrated need under the Waller or Bone-Club analysis,\n        is itself an unlawful closure. See In re Pers. Restraint ofOrange, 152 Wn.2d795,100P.3d\n        291 (2004). It is therefore ironic that the court in Gibbons relied on this separate closure\n        (which it ex ante deemedjustified) as the reason nothing significant took place in the closed\n        courtroom.\n\n\n\n                                                     -9-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

That a bare majority ofthis court\n\n        now prefers the triviality standard we have, time and again, rejected, is not a\n\n        sufficient basis to adopt that standard today. Not only is a course change\n\n        unwarranted, but as explained below, it is also unwise.\n\n           II. The Triviality or De Minimis Doctrine Offers No Clear Guidance for Courts,\n               Stands in Tension with Controlling United States Supreme Court Precedent,\n               and Produces Unjust and Inconsistent Results\n\n               Neither the lead opinion nor Justice Yu's concurrence tells us much about how\n\n        the triviality or de minimis doctrine works in practice. Examination of some cases\n\n        invoking the exception sheds light on its reach. The doctrine purports to isolate the\n\n        tangible values of the public trial right, and then asks the defendant to make a fact-\n\n        based showing that they were harmed.^ For example, since one of the values is to\n\n\n               ^ Based on Peterson, most courts number the values of a public trial at four, citing\n        the passage in Waller extolling the importance of open courts. See, e.g.,Peterson, 85 F.3d\n        at 43 (citing Waller, 467 U.S. at 46-47 and listing as nonexhaustive the values of (1)\n        ensuring a fair trial,(2)reminding the prosecutor and judge of their responsibilities to the\n        accused and the importance of their role,(3) encouraging witnesses to come forward, and\n        (4) discouraging perjury). This reflects a reductionist reading of Waller, which does not\n\n\n                                                    -10-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

See, e.g., Gibbons,555 F.3d at 121 (holding values\n\n        of encouraging witnesses to come forward and discouraging perjury were not\n\n        implicated by closed voir dire because no witnesses testified). It also looks at the\n\n        length of the closure, when it occurred (for example, during voir dire or midtrial),\n\n        and whether it was inadvertent. See, e.g., Peterson, 85 F.3d at 41 (finding error\n\n        trivial when bailiff inadvertently kept courtroom locked during 15-20 minutes of\n\n        witness's testimony); State v.

Compare Peterson,85 F.3d at 43(applying triviality\n\n        standard to courtroom closure during witness testimony), with Tinsley v. United\n\n\n\n\n        purport to reduce the value of openness to a meager list, but more broadly explains that\n        '\"judges, lawyers, witnesses, and jurors will perform their respective functions more\n        responsibly in an open court than in secret proceedings.'\" 467 U.S. at 46 n.4(quoting Estes\n        V.

Following a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court\n\n        and rehearing En Banc in the Second Circuit, the panel vacated its opinion and\n\n        reversed course. See Gupta II, 699 F.3d at 682 n.*. In Gupta II, the panel found the\n\n        conclusion directly opposite its prior holding to be obvious: \"Whatever the outer\n\n        boundaries of our 'triviality standard' may be (and we see no reason to define these\n\n        boundaries in the present context), a trial court's intentional, unjustified closure of a\n\n        courtroom during the entirety of voir dire cannot be deemed 'trivial.'\" Id. at 689.\n\n               Beyond being rudderless, the triviality standard demands of a defendant proof\n\n        that will generally be unavailable. As noted, it places upon the defense the burden\n\n        ofshowing that an unlawful closure in fact undermined some or all ofthe core values\n\n        ofthe public trial right. See Peterson, 85 F.3d at 42; concurrence at 8. This requires\n\n        evidence, which may not be available when a closure is unaccompanied by a\n\n        transcript or other record. In rejecting application of a harmless error standard to\n\n        public trial error, the United States Supreme Court in Waller recognized that \"'it\n\n        would be difficult to envisage a case in which [the defendant] would have evidence\n\n        available of specific injury.'\" 467 U.S. at 49 n.9 (quoting United States ex rel.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -14-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

Critics have thus recognized\n\n        that the triviality test encounters the same difficulty as harmless error review and is\n\n        in tension with Waller.

Even this small sampling of case law confirms that the doctrine\n\n        offers little guidance, as no single consideration is dispositive or any public trial\n\n        value sufficient in and ofitself.

In sum, the\n\n        triviality doctrine operates as an ad hoc, post hoc, sniff test. Its sole purpose is to\n\n        allow appellate courts to excuse public trial violations when the trial, on the whole,\n\n        seems fair enough.\n\n               Albeit subtly, the majority in this case recognizes that the United States\n\n        Supreme Court has never embraced the triviality doctrine as consistent with its\n\n        public trial jurisprudence under the Sixth Amendment. See concurrence at 5 n.2\n\n        (stating the inverse proposition: \"The Supreme Court ofthe United States has never\n\n        rejected the possibility of a de minimis closure\"). The recent decision in Weaver,\n\n        which recognized the petitioner must show prejudice to establish an ineffective\n\n        assistance of counsel claim in a collateral attack on a conviction, does not\n\n        foreshadow the Supreme Court's eventual adoption of a triviality test. While the\n\n        court there rejected the argument that an unjustified closure necessarily renders a\n\n        trial \"fundamentally unfair,\" this was in the context of rejecting an automatic\n\n        prejudice rule for purposes of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See\n\n        Weaver, 137 S. Ct. at 1911. The court in Weaver adhered to its precedents in Waller\n\n        and Presley, reaffirming that although courtroom closures may be justified in some\n\n        circumstances, it is \"'still incumbent upon' the trial court 'to consider all reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -16-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

As noted, critics have recognized the obvious tension between\n\n        adherence to the Waller test and application ofa triviality analysis, in that the former\n\n        requires a preclosure examination ofjustified reasons to close a proceeding, while\n\n        the latter eschews this requirement to excuse a closure after the fact.\n\n               Furthermore, application of a triviality test is inconsistent with United States\n\n        Supreme Court precedent that refuses to reduce specific Sixth Amendment\n\n        protections to a generalized \"fairness\" inquiry; the Court has warned that this\n\n        approach\n\n               in effect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed version of the Due\n               Process Clause—and then proceeds to give no effect to the details. It is true\n               enough that the purpose ofthe rights set forth in that Amendment is to ensure\n               a fair trial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disregarded so long as\n               the trial is, on the whole, fair. What the Government urges upon us here is\n               what was urged upon us (successfully, at one time,see Ohio v. Roberts, 448\n               U.S. 56,100 S. Ct. 2531,65 L.

What it fails to appreciate, however, is that the\n\n        structural error analysis compelled under the Sixth Amendment by Waller, and under\n\n        article I, section 22 of our state constitution by Bone-Club, is not a rigid rule. As\n\n        explained below, these cases fully allow courts to meaningfully assess when it is\n\n        possible to close proceedings consistent with the constitutional guaranty of a public\n\n        trial. But, unlike the triviality doctrine, they provide a principled analysis that\n\n        safeguards the public trial right.\n\n           III.

There is no such rule. Behind the seemingly draconian\n\n        label of \"structural error\" is the real public trial doctrine that has developed since\n\n        Waller. This doctrine is flexible and takes into account the competing values that\n\n        face a trial court in deciding whether to close a particular proceeding.\n\n               Waller and Bone-Club recognize that the defendant's right to a public trial is\n\n        not absolute but may give way to other values, including the right to a fair trial or\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -18-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

The proponent of closure or sealing must make some showing [of\n               a compelling interest], and where that need is based on a right other than an\n               accused's right to a fair trial, the proponent must show a 'serious and\n               imminent threat' to that right.\n                      \"2.

The majority's adoption ofan ex ante triviality standard only\n\n        muddies the waters by suggesting to trial courts that in addition to engaging in a\n\n        Bone-Club analysis, they should consider whether an appellate court will deem a\n\n        closure made without such analysis too trivial to warrant reversal in any event.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        against disproportionate capital sentencing. For the reasons given in this opinion, I\n\n        would reverse Schierman's death sentences and remand for imposition of the only\n\n        statutorily permissible penalty: four consecutive sentences of life in prison without\n\n        the possibility of parole.\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n\n              On the morning of July 17, 2006, officials responded to a fire at the home of\n\n        Leonid and Olga Milkin, a married couple.              When firefighters eventually\n\n        extinguished the flames, they found the bodies of Olga, Olga's sister Lyuba, and\n\n        Leonid and Olga's two young sons, Andrew and Justin. The women's bodies\n\n        appeared to have been undressed or partially undressed at the time of the fire. At\n\n        the time of the fire, Leonid' was stationed overseas. An investigation revealed that\n\n        someone had used accelerants to set the fire, and autopsies revealed that each victim\n\n        had been stabbed to death before the fire began.\n\n               On the morning of the fire, witnesses observed someone who looked like the\n\n        defendant, Conner Schierman, carrying a gas can in front ofthe Milkin home. Police\n\n        contacted Schierman and observed that he had scratches and cuts on his face, head,\n\n        and neck. Schierman told them that he had intervened in a domestic dispute in the\n\n        early morning hours ofJuly 17 and had been hurt in the process. Police subsequently\n\n\n\n              'First names are used when needed for elarity.\n                                                  2\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        discovered a videotape of Schierman filling a gas can at a nearby AMPM on the\n\n        morning of the fire. Eventually, Schierman agreed to come to the police station,\n\n        where he made three taped statements.\n\n              In his third statement, Schierman admitted to being in the Milkin home. He\n\n        said that he woke up on the morning of July 17 covered in blood, lying in an upstairs\n\n        bedroom in the Milkins' home and unable to remember how he had gotten there. He\n\n        stated that he walked around the house, discovered the four bodies, showered and\n\n        changed his clothes, and decided to bum down the house.\n\n              That statement to police was largely consistent with a later statement that\n\n        Schierman made to defense expert Dr. Andrew Saxon. Schierman told Dr. Saxon\n\n        that he started drinlcing in the early evening of July 16, continued drinking all\n\n        evening, and went into an alcoholic blackout some time during that night. He said\n\n        that he woke up bloody on a strange bed some time during the moming of July 17,\n\n        and discovered a woman's body in a pool of blood. But Schierman also told Dr.\n\n        Saxon that he moved the woman's body and continued to drink while he stayed in\n\n        the house.\n\n\n              Eventually,    forensic    investigators   discovered    Schierman's     DNA\n\n        (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the Milkin home. Investigators also found a pair of\n\n        gloves in the home, which a witness identified as belonging to Schierman. When\n\n        Leonid was permitted to retum to his house, he found a fire-damaged knife, which\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Leonid also discovered a pair\n\n        of men's shoes, recovered from an undamaged section of the basement. Schierman\n\n        had purchased an identical pair the previous November. Finally, police also found\n\n        three empty vodka bottles in a backpack in Schierman's bedroom.\n\n                The State charged Schierman with four counts of aggravated murder in the\n\n        first degree and one count of arson in the first degree. Jury selection began on\n\n        November 13, 2009, and the jury panel was seated two months later, on January 12,\n\n        2010.\n\n\n                The guilt phase ofthe trial lasted another three months. The defense conceded\n\n        that Schierman committed arson, but argued that he panicked and set fire to the house\n\n        to avoid being accused of murders that he did not commit. Schierman was convicted\n\n        as charged. The penalty phase lasted almost one month; the jury voted to impose\n\n        the death penalty.\n\n                The facts relevant to each of Schierman's assignments of error are\n\n        summarized in the appropriate section below.\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Some of the Trial Court's Juror Eligibility Determinations Violated\n                    Schierman's Right To Presence (under the Sixth and Fourteenth\n                    Amendments and Article I, Sections 3 and 22); Any Error, However,\n                    Was Harmless\n\n              Schierman argues that two separate phases ofjuror selection violated his right\n\n        to presence. The first phase to which he assigns error lasted from late September\n\n        2009 to mid-November 2009. During that time, counsel met with King County's\n\n        jury services manager to review, and sometimes agree to, potential jurors'\n\n        preliminary hardship excusal requests. Schierman was not present during these\n\n        meetings.\n\n              The second phase of juror selection to which Schierman assigns error took\n\n        place on January 12, 2010, the last day of voir dire. During this phase, counsel met\n\n        with the trial judge in chambers, where counsel argued, and the judge ruled on,\n\n        several for-cause juror challenges. Schierman was not present.\n\n              Schierman argues that excluding him from both phases violated his right to\n\n        presence under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n\n        Constitution, and article I, sections 3 and 22 of the Washington State Constitution.\n\n        We conclude that he had no right to presence when his attorneys reviewed juror\n\n        declarations in the nonadversarial setting of the jury administrator's office. We\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        conclude that he did have a right' to presence during the hearing on for-cause\n\n        challenges, but that the error does not require reversal. Because the facts concerning\n\n        these proceedings are relevant to both the presence claim (discussed here) and the\n\n        courtroom closure claim (discussed below), we describe those facts here.\n\n                     A. Facts\n\n\n                        1. Preliminary Excusals for Hardship (Late September to Mid-\n                           November 2009)\n\n              The documents in the record on this appeal show that in late September 2009,\n\n        jury summonses were issued to 3,000 people, directing them to report for service on\n\n        November 13, 2009. A summons recipient could respond by confirming that he or\n\n        she would appear or by submitting a declaration that he or she was unqualified or\n\n        unable to serve. The recipients were told that their responses were made under\n\n        penalty of perjury. Judge Gregory Canova directed the jury services manager for\n\n        King County, Gregory Wheeler, to review declarations of hardship with the\n\n        prosecutor and defense counsel.\n\n              Per King County Superior Court's general policy, potential jurors could get\n\n        hardship excusals for disability, age, a severe financial burden, or prior jury service,\n\n        or because the potential juror was a single parent with young children not attending\n\n        day care. Due to the anticipated length ofSchierman's trial, it was also contemplated\n\n        that jurors might be excused for reasons that normally warrant only a deferral, e.g.,\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        travel plans, employment, or school. Wheeler conducted a preliminary review of\n\n        the potential juror responses and created two stacks of exeusal requests: one for\n\n        \"those that were clearly meant to be excused per court policy\" and one for \"requests\n\n        noting a hardship of a less-than-obvious nature.\" Clerk's Papers(CP)at 21347-48.\n\n        He then met separately with the prosecution and defense regarding both categories\n\n        of hardship request.\n\n              If everyone agreed that a declaration stated a \"hardship\" as defined by official\n\n        court policy. Wheeler excused the potentialjuror without further review by the court.\n\n        If the parties disagreed. Wheeler saved the disputed hardship request so that Judge\n\n        Canova could review it at a hearing. This process went on between October 19 and\n\n        November 6, 2009.\n\n              The particular proceedings from which Schierman claims he was excluded\n\n        were the times when his lawyers, without the State's lawyers,^ went to an\n\n        administrative office in the courthouse to look at either hard copies of or a computer\n\n        screen displaying summoned jurors' e-mailed hardship requests (for reasons not\n\n        clear on this record, the screen could not be downloaded).^ Schierman says that he\n\n\n\n              ^ It appears that the two sets of lawyers met with Wheeler at different times.\n\n              ^ The record does not contain any transcripts concerning the development or\n        execution of this procedure. The documents are silent about these topics. Nor do we have\n        anything to supplement our understanding of how this off-the-record review of paper and\n        electronic documents was developed or carried out, since this is a direct appeal.\n                                                    7\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        was never present at any ofthese early hardship excusal reviews or conferences. The\n\n        State does not dispute that assertion. Schierman was present, however, at all the\n\n        hearings over disputed hardship requests. Thus, there is no claim that Schierman\n\n        was deprived of the right to presence at any court proceeding or at any noncourt\n\n        adversarial proceeding. Instead, Schierman claims only that he was excluded from\n\n        office visits where attorneys looked at a screen or papers for information.\n\n        Appellant's Opening Br. at 17-18(\"The judge made it clear that he would not review\n\n        the individual hardship requests if the parties were in agreement. . . .

On that day, prospective jurors completed the questionnaire\n\n        \"designed to let [them] tell the court and the lawyers about [themselves] and about\n\n        [their] views on a variety of issues.\" Verbatim Report ofProceedings(VRP)(Nov.\n\n        13, 2009) at 9.\n\n                          2. Far-Cause Challenges in Chambers (January 12, 2010)\n\n              The record tells us quite a bit more about the challenges for cause conducted\n\n        in chambers—with both sets of attorneys, the judge, and the court reporter, but\n\n        without Schierman—^than it tells us about what occurred during the preliminary\n\n        hardship excusal reviews.

At the end of that day, Schierman challenged six jurors for\n\n        cause: Jurors 25, 44, 58, 76, 104, and 171. The court heard argument from both\n\n        parties on those challenges, but deferred ruling so that the parties could further\n\n        question the six jurors on the following day.\n\n              On the following day, the State questioned Jurors 25 and 58. When that\n\n        questioning was over, Judge Canova stated, in open court, that he would rule \"back\n\n        in[] chambers\" on a number of hardship and for-cause challenges to potential jurors:\n\n                     The next thing is that counsel and I are going to go with the court\n              reporter briefly back into chambers, I'm going to rule on a number of\n              requests for hardship that have been received by the court, I'm also\n              going to rule on a number of challenges for cause that are before the\n              court, that is, requests to excuse jurors for different reasons from\n              counsel. That will take less than ten minutes, and at the conclusion of\n              that I will advise all of you who have been excused, if anyone, and we\n              will then proceed to have counsel exercise their peremptory challenges,\n              that is the selection of the jury will follow.\n\n        VRP(Jan. 12, 2010) at 15-16.\n\n              The minute entry for that same day confirms:\n\n              Defendant and respective counsel present\n\n              Voir dire continues\n\n\n              Court and counsel meet in chambers re hardship and challenges\n\n              Court excuses # 424, 356, 265, 218, 172, 168, 130, 104, 79, 25 (and\n              208 separately)\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

The State opposed a for-cause challenge to\n\n        both jurors. The judge nevertheless dismissed jurors 25 and 58 for cause because\n\n        they indicated that they would hold it against Schierman if he did not testify. The\n\n        defense also challenged jurors 76, 171, 104, and 44 for cause based on statements\n\n        that they would not \"consider alcohol as contributing to mental state or lesser mental\n\n        state.\" VRP(Jan. 12,2010)at 20. Judge Canova denied all four challenges because\n\n        he did not think thejurors' statements indicated an inability to be \"fair and impartial\"\n\n        jurors. Id. at 20-22. He also granted hardship requests to Jurors 49, 79, 130, 172,\n\n        265, 356, and 424.

The judge, lawyers, and court reporter then went back out to the open\n\n        courtroom, and the judge explained what had just occurred in chambers:\n\n                     The following jurors have been excused: Juror number 424,juror\n              number 356, juror number 265, juror number 218, juror number 172,\n              juror number 168,juror number 130,juror number 104,juror number\n              79,juror number 58,juror number 49,juror number 25.

Instead, it is more similar to the situation in Slert, where\n\n        such facts militated in favor of finding any error harmless. 186 Wn.2d at 875-76\n\n        (factual differences from Irby compelled a conclusion different from the conclusion\n\n        in Irby).\n\n              Further, Schierman does not specifically allege any prejudice resulting from\n\n        the error here. Nor is any prejudice evident from the record. As noted above, the\n\n        two jurors who were excused after the for-cause challenges (jurors 25 and 58) were\n\n        both excused at the defendant's behest. And of the four jurors whom the defense\n\n        challenged unsuccessfully, only Juror 76 ultimately sat on Schierman's jury.\n\n        Schierman does not explain how defense decisions on peremptory challenges were\n\n        handled. Thus, although we conclude that the trial court erred in hearing for-cause\n\n        challenges outside Schierman's presence, on this record we find the error harmless.\n\n\n                  Id. at 883 (citing Commonwealth v.

He also argues that his public trial right was violated\n\n        when counsel challenged several jurors for cause in chambers on the final day of\n\n        voir dire (January 12, 2010). He asserts that the remedy for each error is reversal of\n\n        his convictions.\n\n\n                       A. Preliminary hardship determinations\n\n                           1.

And we concluded that\n\n        hardship determinations do not implicate the concerns underlying the public trial\n\n        right, at least where no juror was excused for hardship without further (on-the-\n\n        record) proceedings unless all parties agreed.

Merits\n\n\n               The State argues that the public trial right does not attach to the proceeding at\n\n        issue here—a proceeding that entailed both arguments and rulings on for-cause juror\n\n        challenges. It contends that the public trial right attaches to juror questioning, but\n\n        not to counsel's for-cause challenges or the trial court's rulings thereon. In support\n\n        ofthat argument,the State asserts that the proceeding at issue here was \"functionally\n\n        a sidebar.\" Br. of Resp't at 54-55.\n\n               We reject this argument and reaffirm that the public trial right attaches to juror\n\n        challenges and the rulings thereon.

The State explained\n\n        that although the information cited to the correct statute where it alleged the\n\n        existence of aggravating circumstances, it omitted part of the statutory language.\n\n        The information alleged that there was \"more than one victim; Contrary to . . .\n\n       [ROW] 10.95.020(10),\" CP at 1-2, but the full language of RCW 10.95.020(10)\n\n        reads: \"There was more than one victim and the murders were part ofa common\n\n        scheme or plan or the result ofa single act ofthe person\"(Emphasis added.) The\n\n        State moved to amend the information to add the missing language.\n\n              The court heard argument on that motion on November 3, 2009. The State\n\n        admitted its error but argued that the amendment would not prejudice the defense,\n\n        since \"there ha[d] never been . . . any question in this case as to which aggravating\n\n        factor was alleged.\" VRP(Nov. 3, 2009)at 100. The defense objected that it would\n\n        be prejudiced ifthe State were permitted to amend the information. It argued that it\n\n        would have conducted discovery differently had it known that the State would allege\n\n        that the murders were part of a common scheme or plan, the result of a single act of\n\n        the person, or both.\n\n              The court granted the State's motion to amend the information, concluding\n\n        that the defense would not be prejudiced since if the amendment changed the\n                                                 38\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The court's order\n\n        states that the \"Amended information corrects [a] scrivener's error.\" CP at 6764.\n\n        The amended information is identical to the original information except that it\n\n        alleges the full aggravating circumstance listed in RCW 10.95.020(10): \"There was\n\n        more than one victim and the murders were part ofa common scheme or plan or the\n\n        result ofa single act ofthe person.\" CP at 6766-68 (emphasis added).\n\n              The State filed a new death penalty notice on the same day (November 3,\n\n        2009). CP at 6769. The defense filed a motion to strike that notice, arguing that the\n\n        original notice of special proceedings had been based on a faulty charging\n\n        information and that it was now too late to file another notice. The court denied that\n\n        motion, ruling that the original charging information had properly pleaded the\n\n        aggravating circumstance listed at RCW 10.95.020(10).\n\n                     B. Analysis\n              Schierman argues that the original information did not properly charge him\n\n        with aggravated first degree murder, that the original notice of special sentencing\n\n        proceeding was therefore invalid, and that the subsequent notice of special\n\n        sentencing proceeding was therefore untimely. Accordingly, he argues that the State\n\n        never filed a valid notice of special sentencing proceeding and that it therefore may\n\n        not seek the death penalty. He relies on Dearbone and Luvene.\n\n\n\n                                                 39\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n               We disagree. Schierman does not point to any defect in the content or timing\n\n        ofthe original notice ofspecial sentencing proceeding. He identifies instead a defect\n\n        in the information, i.e., that it failed to specifically allege that the murders were \"part\n\n        of a common scheme or plan or the result of a single act ofthe person.\" CP at 6764-\n\n        68. That is not a defect in the death notice. And,in fact, the information did contain\n\n        the \"common scheme or plan\" language—just not in the usual place. Its failure to\n\n        include the \"single act of the person\" language is not a defect in the content, filing,\n\n        or service ofthe death notice. ROW 10.95.020(10). We therefore reject Schierman's\n\n        argument that the notice of special sentencing proceeding was invalid.\n\n               V.

Facts\n\n              On December 30, 2009, the State served the defense with a \"Supplemental\n\n        Memorandum And Materials In Support Of Admission Of Crime Scene And\n\n        Autopsy Photographs That Include Images Of The Victims.\" CP at 7200 (italics\n\n        omitted). The memorandum contained a list of photographs and corresponding\n\n        expert witness \"Declaration[s]\" interpreting the images therein. CP at 7231.\n\n        According to the defense, some ofthe interpretations suggested the State's intent to\n\n        \"assert[] some type of sexual motivation.\" CP at 7201-02. Of particular concern\n\n        was medical examiner Dr. Richard Harruffs description of photograph 2548, which\n\n        read as follows: \"Shows the victims' legs are spread apart, in all likelihood not a\n\n        result of the fire but probably reflects positioning prior to the fire; this photo also\n\n        shows a flashlight in the debris.\" CP at 7232. The defense believed this description\n\n        contradicted statements Dr. Harruff made in a 2007 defense interview to the effect\n\n        that he found nothing unusual about the posing of the victims' bodies and attributed\n\n        their positioning to the \"thermal effect\" of the house fire. CP at 7203-04 (boldface\n\n        omitted). It also argued that any attempt by the prosecution to present a sexual\n\n        motivation theory directly conflicted with the State's earlier stipulation that \"there\n\n        is no physical evidence of sexual assault of any of [the] victims.\" CP at 7202\n\n        (underline omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                  56\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

Instead, it said it had agreed only that\n\n        \"there is no phvsical evidence of sexual assault.\" CP at 7347(boldface omitted). It\n\n        also argued that the defense had known \"for literally years\" about the circumstantial\n\n        evidence of a sexual motive, and that there was no legitimate reason for defense\n\n\n\n                  CP at 7201 (\"As a result of the [State's] non-diselosure .. . the defense is foreed\n        to proeeed to trial unprepared.\"), 7209 (\"the jury pool has not been death qualified with\n        respect to [a sexual motivation] aggravator\"); VRP (Jan. 11, 2010) at 3-4 (\"the [jury]\n        selection process is .. . constitutionally defective . . . particularly given the late disclosure\n        of discovery that we received from the prosecutor on December the 30th ...[that] changes\n        the whole picture ....

It rejected defense counsel's argument that voir dire would\n\n        have been conducted differently if the defense had known about the sexual\n\n        motivation theory. The trial court instead agreed with the State that the defense had\n\n        received ample notice that there was \"circumstantial evidence of a sexual motive.\"\n\n        VRP (Jan. 19, 2010) at 147. This evidence was, according to the trial court, crime\n\n        scene photos showing that Olga's and Botvina's bodies had been found nude or\n\n        mostly nude, the presence at the crime scene of a \"probable fire trailer consisting of\n\n        women's underwear,\" and allegations that the defendant made sexual comments\n\n        about one of the victims. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1175915\"><a href=\"/opinion/1175915/state-v-hughes/\">Id. at 148-49</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

In that\n\n       respect, IhQ fact of sexual motivation was not at issue in the case, but this did not\n\n        mean that the State agreed not to argue any sexual motivation theory.

Dr. Harruff, the medical\n\n        examiner, testified that Olga's and Lyuba's bodies had been found nude or mostly\n\n        nude, and Kim Duddy, a forensic scientist, testified that Lyuba's clothing had been\n\n        removed after she was killed.

Facts\n\n\n              Leonid, Olga's husband and Andrew and Justin's father, was a United States\n\n        soldier stationed in Iraq at the time ofthe murders. On October 28,2009,the defense\n\n        filed \"Defendant's Motion to Preclude Soldiers in Fatigues from Attending\n\n        Proceedings.\" CP at 6443. It stated that defense counsel expected that uniformed\n\n        soldiers would attend the trial, and that this expectation was \"based on prior\n\n        experience on this case, where the usual practice has been for soldiers in fatigues to\n\n        sit in the courtroom, behind the prosecutor's table, close to and in full view [of]\n\n        jurors who will not only decide whether Schierman committed the offense, but also\n        whether he will live or die.\" CP at 6444. Defense counsel requested in the\n\n        alternative that the court permit videotaping ofthe courtroom audience.\n\n              The trial court heard oral arguments on the motion on November 5, 2009.

The trial court\n\n        thus excluded evidence that he was stationed in Iraq.\n\n              That order was violated almost immediately. At trial, Leonid was the State's\n\n        first witness.

It necessarily varies\n              according to the peculiar circumstances of each case. Consideration of\n              a matter may continue over a prolonged period—hours, days or even\n              longer. Then again, it may cover but a brief span of minutes. If one\n              forming an intent to kill does not act instantly, but pauses and actually\n\n\n                 WPIC 10.01 defines \"intent\" as \"aeting with the objeetive or purpose to\n        aeeomplish a result that constitutes a crime.\" 11 WPIC 10.01, at 217.\n                                                 75\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Clark, 143 Wn.2d\n\n        at 771.\n\n\n              Schierman acknowledges this line of cases, but asks this court to \"reconsider\n\n        the pattern instructions because they do not differentiate between intent and\n\n        premeditation in any meaningful way.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 89.\n\n\n\n                                                77\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Schierman timely objected and offered his own instructions on this point.\n\n        Schierman's proposed instructions are good alternatives to the pattern instruction;\n\n        certainly, the trial court would not have erred by giving any of those alternative\n\n        instructions. But Schierman does not offer any argument that this court has not\n\n        previously addressed, and he does not show that our prior precedent on this issue is\n\n        incorrect and harmful. We therefore decline his invitation to overrule that precedent.\n\n              Alternatively, Schierman argues that his Fourteenth Amendment right to due\n\n        process was violated when the State used a baseball analogy in closing argument to\n\n        explain the difference between \"intent\" and \"premeditation.\" Id. at 90-93; U.S.\n\n        Const, amend. XIV. Schierman does not allege that this analogy constituted\n\n        prosecutorial misconduct, and he does not cite any authority for the assertion that it\n\n       resulted in a due process violation. We therefore reject it.\n\n                     B. Schierman's proposed instruction on voluntary intoxication\n\n                        1. Facts\n\n\n              The defense proposed the following instruction on voluntary intoxication:\n\n                 The prosecution must prove that the defendant committed\n              Aggravated First Degree Murder with premeditation and/or Murder in\n              the Second Degree with intent. The defendant contends that he did not\n              have the required intent and mental state due in whole or part to his\n              intoxication. However, the defendant does not need to prove that he\n              did not have the required intent and mental state.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 78\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n                 If you have a reasonable doubt about whether the defendant\n              committed the crime with premeditation, intent, criminal recklessness\n              or criminal negligence, you must find the defendant not guilty.\n\n        CP at 7654. The court denied that request and gave the standard WPIC on voluntary\n\n        intoxication instead:\n\n\n                 No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary\n              intoxication is less criminal by reason of that condition. However,\n              evidence ofintoxication may be considered in determining whether the\n              defendant acted with intent or premeditation.\n\n        CP at 7849. The defense objected to the first sentence of that instruction, arguing\n\n        that it \"seems to contradict and vitiate the next line.\" VRP (Apr. 7, 2010) at 17-18.\n\n        The court rejected that argument because the WPIC mirrored the language in RCW\n\n        9A.16.090, the Washington criminal code statute addressing voluntary intoxication.\n\n        Id. at 18.\n\n\n                        2. Analysis\n               Schierman contends that the trial court should have omitted the first sentence\n\n        ofthe WPIC on voluntary intoxication because that sentence renders the instruction\n\n        \"Montradictorv and lalmbiguous.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 93. He is correct\n\n        that there is some tension between the first sentence, implying that intoxication is\n\n        not relevant to the question ofguilt, and the second sentence,stating that intoxication\n\n        \"may be\" relevant to guilt. CP at 7849. But he does not show that the trial court\n\n        erred. He contends that the trial court should instead have borrowed language from\n\n\n                                                  79\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

In reaching that conclusion, the Coates court actually approved of a jury\n\n        instruction that exactly tracked the language of Washington's voluntary intoxication\n\n        defense statute, RCW 9A.16.090, which provides:\n\n              No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication\n              shall be deemed less criminal by reason of his condition, but whenever\n              the actual existence ofany particular mental state is a necessary element\n              to constitute a particular species or degree of crime, the fact of his\n              intoxication may be taken into consideration in determining such\n               mental state.\n\n\n        </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201225\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201225/state-v-coates/\">Id. at 889</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n               Schierman also argues that the voluntary intoxication instruction should have\n\n        \"appl[ied] to the aggravating factor of common scheme or plan.\" Appellant's\n\n        Opening Br. at 94.

Facts\n\n              The defense requested lesser included offense instructions on first and second\n\n        degree manslaughter. CP at 7641-51. The requested first degree manslaughter\n\n        instruction read as follows:\n\n\n                     To convict the defendant of the crime of Manslaughter in the\n              First Degree, each of the following elements of the crime must be\n              proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n                   (1) That on the 17th day of July, 2006, Conner Michael\n              Schierman inflicted sharp force injury to [the victim];\n\n                    (2)    That Conner Michael Schierman's acts were reckless;\n\n                    (3)    That [the victim] died as a result of Conner Michael\n              Schierman's acts; and\n\n                    (4)    That the acts occurred in the State of Washington.\n\n        CP at 7643.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Schierman argues that evidence of his intoxication raised an inference that he\n\n        committed manslaughter: \"[T]he defense presented evidence that Schierman was\n\n        severely intoxicated at the time of the offense. The jury could have found that this\n\n        reckless intoxication diminished Schierman's ability to act intentionally, or even to\n\n        knowingly disregard a risk of harm.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 97.\n\n              Schierman presented his intoxication evidence primarily through the\n\n        testimony of Dr. Andrew Saxon, an addiction psychiatrist at the Veteran's Affairs\n\n        Medical Center in Seattle. Dr. Saxon interviewed Schierman in November 2006 and\n\n        February 2007 regarding the events of July 16 and 17, 2006 (the time of the\n\n        murders). He also reviewed Schierman's medical and addiction treatment records.\n\n              In the interviews, Schierman told Dr. Saxon that he had consumed one 375-\n\n        milliliter bottle of vodka at work on July 16, 2006, and taken three or four more\n\n        bottles home with him. Based on Schierman's self-reporting, and on the fact that\n\n        detectives had recovered three empty vodka bottles from Schierman's bedroom three\n\n        days after the murders. Dr. Saxon formed the \"opinion\" that Schierman drank\n\n        heavily on the evening of July 16, 2006.

The State disagrees, contending that no\n\n        error occurred and that if any did, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Schierman's case, the relevant legal distinction\n\n        was between intentional murder(committed by a person whose level ofintoxication\n\n        prevented him from premeditating his offenses) and reckless or negligent murder\n\n        (committed by a person whose intoxication prevented him even from intending those\n\n        offenses). Unlike the instructions given in Condon, the instructions given in\n\n        Schierman's case called the jury's attention to this distinction—and to the defense\n\n        theory that Schierman was in a state of alcoholic blackout when the murders\n\n        occurred.\n\n\n              This is because even though Schierman's jury was not instructed on\n\n        manslaughter, it was instructed on voluntary intoxication.          That instruction\n\n        specifically called the jury's attention to Schierman's intoxication evidence, and it\n\n        specifically told the jury that it could consider this evidence when deciding whether\n\n        the defendant had premeditated or intended the murders. Having heard this\n\n        instruction, the jury nevertheless found that Schierman premeditated the murders—\n\n        that is, it found that he committed the murders with the most conscious and culpable\n\n        mental state. On this record, and given these instructions, there is only one possible\n\n        explanation for that verdict: the jury did not credit the theory that an alcoholic\n\n        blackout diminished Schierman's capacity to premeditate. There is no possibility\n\n        that a manslaughter instruction would have led the jury to a different conclusion.\n                                                 90\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Having\n\n        found only one instructional error and that this error is harmless, we also reject\n\n        Schierman's argument that cumulative instructional error warrants reversal of his\n\n        conviction.\n\n\n                                      Penalty Phase Issues\n\n\n              Schierman raises several challenges to his death sentence.

I conclude that those\n\n        errors require reversal of the death sentences. And they would ordinarily require a\n\n        remand to permit the State to proceed to a new sentencing phase. But this court is\n\n        also required by statute to analyze whether imposing a sentence of death in each\n\n        particular case is proportionate. I further conclude that the sentences ofdeath violate\n\n        Washington's prohibition on disproportionate capital sentencing. For that reason, I\n\n        would reverse the sentences of death and remand with instructions to impose the\n\n        only lawful sentence available for these crimes: four consecutive sentences of life\n\n        in prison without possibility of parole.\n                                                   91\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The first slide compared\n\n        Schierman with inmates in the Florida DOC,the second compared him with capital\n\n        offenders in Texas, and the third compared him with \"capital offenders who obtained\n\n        relief from death sentences 1989-2008.\" Id. Slide 36 stated that among the Florida\n\n        inmates studied, ''''Inmates matching [Schierman] were in the lowest 15% of risk\n\n        classification,\" and had only a \"4.5% [rate of] potentially violent misconduct.\" CP\n\n        at 8307. The second two slides stated that 0 percent of inmates ''matching\n\n        [Schierman]\" committed serious assaults.

The trial\n\n        court did not exclude this evidence for late disclosure.\n\n              The trial court instead excluded it for lack ofrelevance.

In that case, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that\n\n        the same Dr. Cunningham could not provide capital penalty phase testimony about\n\n        the Virginia DOC's \"security interventions\" because they were not relevant to the\n\n        defendant's \"character, history, and background.\" Morva, 278 Va. at 350-51. The\n\n        trial court acknowledged that testimony on future dangerousness was \"clearly . . .\n\n        allowed\" since lack of future dangerousness is a \"statutorily listed mitigat[ing]\n\n        circumstance.\" VRP(Apr. 29, 2010)at 22.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              This passage clearly indicates that when the trial court excluded the \"vast\n\n        majority\" of Dr. Cunningham's testimony, it was applying the rule from Morva-?'^\n       the rule that a defendant's diminished opportunity to commit acts of violence due to\n\n        prison security measures is inadmissible in a capital penalty phase proceeding\n\n        because it is irrelevant to the defendant's character, history, or background.^®\n\n        Morva, 278 Va. at 350-51.\n\n              The court's ruling left the defense with 16 full slides and one partial slide.\n\n        These slides covered topics such as \"Why Conner Schierman is likely to make a\n\n        positive prison adjustment,\" CP at 8302(italics omitted); Schierman's\"Employment\n\n        in Community,\" CP at 8303; \"Constructive Activities in Confinement,\" \"Positive\n\n        Adjustment to Custody,\" and \"Continuing Relationships with Family and Friends,\"\n\n        CP at 8304; and rates ofinmate assault and homicide in Washington DOC facilities.\n\n        They also included a slide listing five personal characteristics that reduced\n\n        Schierman's risk of violence and a slide explaining that \"[pjast violence in the\n\n\n\n\n                  We do not understand the eoncurrence/dissent's contrary               assertion.\n        Concurrence/dissent at 13-14. It is plainly incompatible with the record.\n\n                 Interestingly, the trial court also seems to have believed that information about\n        prison conditions generally was relevant to Schierman's future dangerousness so long as it\n        pertained to Washington DOC facilities. See CP at 8306 (slide ruled admissible, depicting\n        rates of inmate homicide and assault in Washington DOC facilities).\n                                                   96\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Among the slides excluded were the three\n\n       \"individualized . . . actuarial\" likelihood slides comparing Schierman with the\n\n        inmates from other jurisdictions and concluding that he was unlikely to commit any\n\n        acts of violence in prison. VRP (Apr. 29, 2010) at 25.\n\n              The day after the trial court excluded most of Dr. Cunningham's testimony\n\n        and evidence on future dangerousness, the defense filed a declaration from Dr.\n\n        Curmingham explaining actuarial methodology and asking the court to reconsider its\n\n        ruling. The declaration explained that \"there is no individualized assessment of a\n\n        particular person that does not rest on group data of one sort or another.\" CP at\n\n        8266. It explained the importance of the excluded factual data on which Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's opinion rested by stating, among other things, that \"the statistical\n\n        prevalence of a particular behavior over a set period of time ... is the fundamental\n\n        group statistic in risk assessment and is considered to be the single most important\n\n        piece of data necessary in making an accurate risk estimate.\" CP at 8267-68.

It reasoned that \"Dr.\n\n\n       Curmingham is still allowed to testify to the group rates, which he feels are necessary\n\n       as a concept. The group rates, however,are limited to the group behavior as reflected\n\n       from statistics for the[DOC]in the State of Washington, not the[DOCs]in the State\n\n       of Florida, or Texas, or anywhere else.\" VRP (Apr. 30, 2010) at 3.\n\n              After this ruling and another excluding a second PowerPoint presentation\n\n       offered in support of Dr. Curmingham's testimony on a different issue (discussed\n\n        below), the defense decided not to call Dr. Curmingham. During closing argument,\n\n       the State asserted that Schierman had a problem with authority and would have\n\n       contact with other inmates in prison.\n\n                       2.

This argument fails for\n\n        the reasons given in my discussion of Dr. Cunningham's testimony on future\n\n        dangerousness.\n\n              The State also argues that any error is unpreserved because Schierman failed\n\n        to make an adequate offer of proof.

Indeed, the legislature must have contemplated that exact\n\n        scenario when it enacted RCW 10.95.070(6)—^because that subsection allows the\n\n       jury to consider that mitigating factor only after finding that the defendant\n\n        committed intentional, premeditated murder.^^\n\n              Because diminished self-control or decision-making is a relevant mitigating\n\n        factor in a capital sentencing proceeding, the trial court erred in excluding Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's testimony under Guzek.\n\n                            c. The trial court's error in excluding Dr. Cunningham's\n                               presentation on diminished control requires reversal\n\n              Like Dr. Cunningham's presentation on lack of future dangerousness, Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's presentation on diminished control was among the most persuasive\n\n        mitigating evidence offered during the penalty phase. The vast majority ofthe other\n\n        mitigation witnesses were friends or family as opposed to neutral experts. And Dr.\n\n        Cunningham was the only expert who offered admissible evidence on Schierman's\n\n        limited capacity for self-control, something that our legislature has specifically\n\n        identified as relevant in a capital sentencing proceeding. Given the significance of\n\n\n\n                  The State also argues that the mitigating faetor provided in RCW 10.95.070(6)\n        refers to an insanity defense, and that the exclusion of testimony regarding diminished\n        capacity therefore did not impair Schierman's ability to establish this mitigating factor.\n        This argument is meritless. As explained above, Schierman was not attempting to relitigate\n        the questions of intent or premeditation by presenting a diminished capacity defense.\n        Instead, he was attempting to present expert testimony linking his criminal conduct to\n        developmental influences, in contrast to conscious choice.\n                                                  Ill\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Since I am the only one who would reverse the death\n\n        sentence, though, I address Schierman's additional penalty phase claims.\n\n                     C. The trial court erred by excluding Dr. Mark McClung's testimony\n                        regarding past brain injury\n\n                        1. Facts\n\n              On April 27, 2010, the defense offered a letter by Dr. Mark McClung, a\n\n        forensic psychiatrist, stating that past brain injury might have diminished\n\n        Schierman's capacities for self-control and anger management. Dr. McClung based\n\n        this opinion on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of Schierman's brain,\n\n        conducted in July 2009; a review of that MRI by Dr. Wendy Cohen;\n\n        neuropsychological testing conducted by Dr. Paul Connor in April of 2010; and Dr.\n\n        McClung's personal interviews with Dr. Cohen and Dr. Connor.\n\n               Along with Dr. McClung's letter, the defense filed three documents:(1) the\n\n        MRI scan report,(2)an affidavit by Dr. Richard Adler stating that the MRI reflected\n\n        a 1997 concussion and that this was \"not the first incidence of brain injury suffered\n\n        by Conner Schierman,\" CP at 8249-50, and(3)a letter from Dr. Connor to Dr. Adler\n\n\n                                                 112\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       explaining that Schierman had probably suffered multiple head injuries during his\n\n        life. Dr. Connor based this opinion on the fact that \"Schierman and his family have\n\n        reported a number of incidents of domestic violence in which he was struck in the\n\n        head by his biological father.\" CP at 8257.\n\n              The State objected to Dr. McClung's testimony on the grounds that it was\n\n        offered too late and did not meet the          standard for scientific reliability. The\n\n        transcript of the argument on this issue indicates that just as the penalty phase\n\n        proceedings were beginning, Dr. Adler \"discovered what he considered to be\n\n        significant information related to a prior brain trauma\" in Schierman's medical\n\n        records, that defense counsel then marshalled several experts to investigate this\n\n        discovery, and that the defense finally offered Dr. McClung's opinion about one\n\n        week after the penalty phase proceedings began. VRP (Apr. 28, 2010) at 57-58.\n\n              Dr. McClung's letter addressed the issue of brain injury in the following,\n\n        somewhat noncommittal terms:\n\n\n              Mr. Schierman's brain injury may have had no impact on his\n              subsequent emotions or behavior. However, it is possible that it had an\n              impact on subsequent mood problems and intensity of substance abuse.\n              When Mr. Schierman was intoxicated, the brain injury may have\n              contributed to worsening any problems with loss of inhibitions,\n              interpreting his surroundings, and controlling anger/aggression.\n              Violent offending is correlated with increased incidence of brain injury\n              in offender; however, specific cause-and-effect has not been\n              established in all but a few specific cases.\n\n\n                Frye v.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n\n        CP at 8260.\n\n\n              As with Dr. Cunningham's testimony, the State objected to Dr. McClung's\n\n        testimony on the ground that it was offered too late to permit any meaningful cross-\n\n        examination. However, as with Dr. Cunningham's testimony, the court did not\n\n        exclude Dr. McClung's testimony due to late disclosure. Instead, it excluded that\n\n        testimony as speculative,\"based upon a faulty foundation,\" and not \"expressed to a\n\n        reasonable degree of medical certainty.\" VRP (Apr. 29, 2010)at 20, 6.\n\n                        2. Analysis\n              As noted above, the trial court provided two different reasons for excluding\n\n        Dr. McClung's testimony. First, it concluded that the testimony lacked an adequate\n\n        factual foundation. Second, it ruled that the testimony did not meet the threshold for\n\n        admitting expert opinion since it was not expressed to a reasonable degree ofmedical\n\n        certainty.\n\n              With respect to the first conclusion—^that Dr. McClung's testimony lacked an\n\n        adequate factual foundation—I disagree. At the hearing on Dr. McClung's\n\n        testimony, the trial court spent close to 13 minutes examining the \"chain of other\n\n        experts and their evaluations\" that Dr. McClung relied on in forming his opinion.\n\n        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 7-20</span><pre class=\"inline\">. This examination contains medical judgments that the court was not\n\n        qualified to make.     As noted above. Dr. McClung relied on Dr. Connor's\n\n\n                                                 114\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        neuropsychological testing report, which included Dr. Connor's opinion that\n\n        Schierman had probably suffered multiple head injuries, at the hands of his\n\n        biological father, prior to the 1997 concussion. According to Dr. Connor,the earlier\n\n        injuries were significant because they likely worsened the effects of the 1997\n\n        concussion: \"It is well documented that multiple head injuries ha[ve] a cumulative\n\n        effect such that in each subsequent injury, the negative impacts are often greater than\n\n        would be expected from one head injury in isolation.\"         CP at 8257. The trial court\n\n        rejected this theory, ruling that there was no \"foundation\" for any expert's\n\n        conclusion that Schierman had suffered multiple head injuries. VRP(Apr.29,2010)\n\n        at 20.\n\n\n                 It is not entirely clear why the court reached that conclusion. Certain parts of\n\n        the transcript indicate that the court believed the MRI conclusively proved that\n\n        Schierman had suffered only one brain injury.^^ (According to the offer of proof,\n\n        the MRI revealed that Schierman had suffered at least one, but not necessary only\n\n\n\n\n                 In his affidavit in support ofDr. McClung's proposed testimony. Dr. Adler stated\n        that \"the effect(s) of the 1997 [concussion reflected in the MRI] was/were likely made\n        more serious by precedent head trauma.\" CP at 8250.\n\n                  VRP(Apr. 29,2010)at 8(\"Dr. Cowen's re-evaluation ofthe MRI[]... concludes\n        that... there was evidence of a prior insult — that is singular\"), 15 (\"[Dr. Adler] does seem\n        to ignore [Dr. Cowen's] conclusion, as Dr. Connor did, that there was evidence of one, a,\n        prior injury or insult... shown in the rereading ofthe MRI.\").\n\n\n                                                    115\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

But the majority of the court's comments on the issue indicate\n\n        that it just didn't think that Schierman's father hit Schierman hard enough or often\n\n        enough in the head to sustain any expert's conclusion that Schierman had suffered\n\n        multiple head injuries.'^®\n\n               This medical conclusion exceeded the trial court's expertise. Both Schierman\n\n        and his sister told Dr. Cunnningham about an incident in which their biological\n\n        father picked Schierman up and slammed him face first into a brick hearth. This\n\n        occurred when Schierman was 9 or 10 years old.                    Schierman also told Dr.\n\n        Cunningham that his father often shook him so hard that his head flopped back and\n\n        forth, and that his father threw him against walls and kicked him down stairs.\n\n        Schierman's mother reported that Schierman's father slapped him so hard that it left\n\n        marks.\n\n\n               It is not clear whether Dr. McClung would have testified that these prior\n\n        injuries likely worsened the effects of Schierman's documented 1997 concussion—\n\n        his proposed testimony did not explicitly endorse that particular portion of Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                  E.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 13-14</span><pre class=\"inline\">(\"[In his interview with Dr. Cunningham,[t]he defendant relates\n        this incident that his sister [also] related . . . where their father grabbed the defendant and\n        threw him face first on to the brick hearth.

While Dr. McClung\n\n        did not testify that prior brain injury probably impaired Schierman's capacities, he\n\n        did testify that it possibly impaired Schierman's capacities. Some jurors might\n\n        consider that possibility to be a circumstance meriting leniency. Thus, even if Dr.\n\n        McClung's testimony did not establish a probability of diminished capacity, it still\n\n        might serve as a basis to impose a sentence less than death.        Dr. McClung's\n\n        testimony is therefore relevant mitigating evidence in the penalty phase.

The summaries referred generally to Schierman's personal\n\n        characteristics and/or emotional relationship with the witness.\"^^ The State moved to\n\n        exclude most of these witnesses as cumulative.\n\n\n               The trial court ruled that the defense could select up to 12 ofthe listed family\n\n        members and 2 teachers or school counselors to testify as to Schierman's character.\n\n        It ruled that the defense could select up to 15 ofthe remaining lay witnesses to testify\n\n        as to Schierman's character, but that these witnesses could testify about Schierman's\n\n        history of alcohol blackouts only to the extent that the defense experts did not cover\n\n        this subject. Finally, the court ruled that the defense could call just one treatment\n\n        professional from the Lakeside-Milam Recovery Center(Lakeside-Milam).\n\n               The trial court also limited the scope of the lay witness testimony.

The court agreed that\n\n        Vail's testimony was \"certainly relevant . . . on the statutory mitigating\n\n        circumstances of future dangerousness or lack thereof,\" but ruled that if Vail\n\n\n\n                                                 122\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Analysis\n\n              Schierman argues that the trial court committed eight errors in excluding or\n\n        limiting this mitigation testimony. We address each alleged error separately.\n\n                           a. Exclusion of mitigation character witness testimony as\n                              cumulative\n\n              Schierman contends that it was error to exclude mitigation witnesses on the\n\n        ground that their testimony was cumulative. He cites his cousin Erica Akingcoye's\n\n        proposed testimony as an example of excluded evidence that \"would have gone to\n\n        Schierman's ability to form strong social bonds with others, and to touch their lives\n\n        in positive ways.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 129 (citing CP at 7893). Schierman\n\n        argues that this type of testimony \"says something about the person [he] was when\n\n        he was not drinking or taking drugs.\" M at 130. He also argues that such testimony\n\n        should not be excluded as cumulative because \"[t]o a large extent, the sheer number\n\n        of witnesses was the very point: a person who has touched and enhanced the lives of\n\n        many people will likely be seen as more deserving of leniency.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\">Id.</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n              We know of no case holding that a trial court erred by excluding mitigating\n\n        character evidence as cumulative in a capital sentencing proceeding.

He implies that even if it\n\n        weren't admissible under the Rules of Evidence, such testimony would still be\n\n        admissible in the penalty phase of a capital case.\n\n                The trial court, however, did not actually exclude testimony about\n\n        Schierman's behavior following his parents' divorce or his father's abuse. Indeed,\n\n        Schierman's mother, stepfather, and sister all testified about the way abuse and\n\n        divorce affected Schierman. VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 44, 70 (Dean Dubinsky\n\n        testifying that Schierman's childhood trauma led him to have emotional and\n\n        substance abuse problems); VRP (Apr. 22,2010) at 108-12(Kinsey testifying about\n\n\n                                                  128\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        physical and emotional abuse; testifying that she \"noticed more of a change in\n\n        [Schierman] just shortly after the separation\"); VRP (Apr. 27, 2010) at 83-88\n\n        (Wendy Dubinsky testifying about the effect that abuse and divorce had on\n\n        Schierman).\n\n              Thus, regardless of some trial court comments seeming to exclude testimony\n\n        on this topic, most of it was,in fact, admitted. Ultimately, Timothy Driver testified\n\n        that when he coached Schierman in high school, he saw signs in Schierman's\n\n        behavior that \"it was .. . uncomfortable for him at home at that time.\" VRP (Apr.\n\n        22,2010)at 40. This is consistent with the summary provided in the defense's April\n\n        9, 2010, supplemental disclosure. And after the defense filed its motion for\n\n        reconsideration, the court ruled that Morrison could testify. Although Morrison was\n\n        ultimately unavailable, the defense substituted Phyllis Roderick, Schierman's junior\n\n        high school counselor. Roderick testified that Schierman \"was a child who was\n\n        angry at dad and mom over what was going on[,]. . . who was slipping into what I\n\n        was concerned might be a depression[,]...[and who] struggl[ed] between wanting\n\n        to be the kid that he was and that need to . . . also be the caretaker for the family.\"\n\n        VRP (Apr. 27, 2010) at 41.\n\n              As for the other proffered witnesses, only Schierman's mother, Linda\n\n        Schierman, testified.   But she testified consistently with the summary in the\n\n        supplemental disclosure, describing her family's legacy ofalcoholism and the abuse\n\n                                                 129\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        that Schierman suffered at the hands ofhis biological father. Thus,it does not appear\n\n        that the court's ruling on lay opinion actually had any limiting effect on Linda\n\n        Schierman's testimony.\n\n              Finally, although Stephanie Overland and Joshua Parker did not testify, we\n\n        cannot tell from the record why the defense did not call them. As explained above,\n\n        the defense called only 12 of the 14 family member witnesses that the trial court\n\n        ultimately permitted. Both Overland and Parker were family members and thus\n\n        could have testified.\n\n\n                           d. Forcing Schierman to choose between Eldon Vail and James\n                                Aiken\n\n\n              Schierman argues that the trial court erred by forcing him to choose between\n\n        Aiken and Vail. He contends that Aiken could have offered his perspective on\n\n        prisons outside Washington State, to which Schierman might one day be transferred.\n\n        The State argues that this error is unpreserved because Schierman failed to object to\n\n        the court's April 19 ruling.\n\n              The State is correct. And, in any event, Aiken's testimony would have been\n\n        entirely cumulative of Vail's. The defense offered both Aiken and Vail as experts\n\n        on Schierman's probable conditions of confinement in the Washington State DOC.\n\n        Vail had much more direct experience with Washington's prisons than Aiken did.\n\n\n\n\n                                                130\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n                              e. Exclusion of Kinsey Schierman's testimony regarding her\n                                own abuse\n\n              Schierman argues that the trial court erred by prohibiting Kinsey Schierman\n\n       from testifying about the way she was affected by her father's abuse.\n\n              The State argues that the trial court acted within its discretion when it\n\n        determined that Kinsey's experience was not relevant. It argues that the jury could\n\n        not assume that their father's abuse affected Kinsey and Schierman in similar ways\n\n        because \"Kinsey was four years younger than Schierman, testified that she suffered\n\n        an alcohol addiction but was successful in recovery, and apparently was not violent\n\n       toward others,\" and because her gender and personality were different from\n\n        Schierman's. Br. ofResp't at 191 (citing VRP (Apr. 22, 2010)at 107, 115).\n\n              We agree with the State that this relevance determination was within the trial\n\n        court's discretion.\n\n\n                              f. Exclusion of Michael Christensen's testimony about his\n                                 experience as a corrections officer\n              Schierman argues that the trial court erred by limiting Christensen's\n\n       testimony. Christensen is both Schierman's uncle and a former corrections officer,\n\n        and the defense offered his opinion testimony on Schierman's adjustment to life in\n\n        prison.\n\n              The court ruled that Christensen could testify about his relationship with\n\n        Schierman, as a family member, but could not \"relat[e] his own employment to\n\n                                                131\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

The\n\n        court explained that that testimony \"is neither relevant [nor] probative of the issues\n\n        present in the penalty [phase] ofthis case.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1173397\"><a href=\"/opinion/1173397/state-v-claflin/\">Id. at 11</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n              The trial court erred here for the same reason it erred in excluding Dr.\n\n        Cunningham's actuarial testimony regarding future dangerousness. The cumulative\n\n        effect of exclusion of all this mitigating evidence also weighs in favor ofreversal of\n\n        the death sentences..\n\n\n                           g. Exclusion of testimony about the effect of an execution on\n                              family members\n              Schierman argues that he should have been allowed to present testimony on\n\n        the effect of his execution on his friends and family. But he failed to object to the\n\n        court's ruling. Because there was no objection, there was no colloquy on this issue.\n\n        Nor was there any relevant offer of proof, so the record does not indicate what\n\n        evidence Schierman would have presented regarding the effect of his execution on\n\n        his friends or family. See CP at 7889-900, 26422-33 (summarizing proposed\n\n        mitigation witness testimony; omitting any reference to the impact of Schierman's\n\n        execution on his friends or family).

Photographs\n                 In his opening brief, Schierman implies that the trial court admitted only 12\n\n        of his many offered photographs of his life. The State points out, correctly, that the\n\n        court actually admitted 35 of Schierman's photographs. Schierman does not explain,\n\n        in either his opening or his reply brief, how he was prejudiced by the 35-photograph\n\n        limit.    When the trial court excluded 42 of the photographs offered through\n\n        Schierman's mother, it ruled that the photographs were \"not relevant or probative in\n\n        that quantity\" because many of them depicted Schierman at the same life stages.\n\n        VRP (Apr. 26, 2010) at 149. With respect to Schierman's artwork, the trial court\n\n        ruled that Schierman could present 12 separate pieces. Schierman asked to display\n\n        a single image ofhis artwork \"in such a way that it could bejust observed en mass[e],\n\n        as opposed to individual pieces,\" presumably because in that way he could present\n\n        more than 12 individual pieces. Id. at 151. The trial court denied this request.\n\n                 The trial court acted within its discretion in placing these minimal limits on\n\n        Schierman's photographs and artwork.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   133\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              II.    The Admission of Certain Victim Impact Testimony Did Not Violate\n                     Schierman's Rights to Due Process or Protection against Cruel\n                     Punishment\n\n              Schierman challenges the trial court's admission oftwo types ofvictim impact\n\n        evidence:(1) a memorial service video tribute to the four victims and (2)testimony\n\n        by several of the victims' family members regarding their immigration from the\n\n        former Soviet Union and the importance of Christianity to them and to the adult\n\n        victims. He argues that the admission of this evidence violated the Eighth and\n\n        Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, sections 3\n\n        and 14 ofthe Washington State Constitution.\n\n                     A. Facts\n\n\n                        1. Memorial service video\n\n              On April 15, 2010, the State offered as penalty phase evidence \"a video that\n\n        was prepared for purposes of a memorial service by the [victims'] family, which\n\n        provides . . . moving images of the four victims in this case . . . [and is] about 15\n\n        minutes long.\" VRP (Apr. 15, 2010) at 110. The defense objected that the State\n\n        should be limited to one \"in-life\" photograph ofeach victim, arguing that \"memorial\n\n        services are beyond the boundaries ofevidence that should be otherwise admissible\"\n\n        because they tend to \"inflame the passions of[the]jury.\" /J. at 111.\n\n              The trial court noted that the State had listed the video in its discovery\n\n        materials in December 2009, and asserted that it was \"a little late to be objecting to\n\n                                                 134\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

But once again,the court gave the defense more time; it allowed\n\n        the defense until noon the following day to submit specific objections in writing.\n\n        The defense then argued that the video was \"well crafted, and it . . . make[s] it\n\n        extremely difficult for [the defense] to put on mitigation.\" VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at\n\n        8.\n\n\n              The State countered that the memorial video was admissible because its\n\n        \"focus on family, the focus on faith, the focus on children, is exactly who these\n\n        people were, in a way that... is unusual for people perhaps in our society, and for\n\n        that reason [the video] truly give[s] the most meaningful glimpse of who these\n\n        people . .. were.\" Id. at 4. The State also suggested that ifthe court concluded that\n\n        the video's music soundtrack was inflammatory, the video could be played without\n\n        sound.\n\n\n              The court ruled that the video was largely admissible under State v. Gregory,\n\n        in which this court held that victim impact evidence is admissible in the penalty\n\n        phase of a capital case, so long as it does not'\"so infect[] the sentencing proceeding\n\n        as to render it fundamentally unfair.'\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">158 Wn.2d 759</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 852, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621432\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621432/state-v-gregory/\">147 P.3d 1201</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006)\n\n        (quoting Payne v.

Lybov and Pavel testified that both oftheir families came to the United\n\n        States as political refugees, sponsored by the Catholic Church, because they were\n\n        persecuted in the former Soviet Union for their Christianity.

Instead, the court ruled, the State needed\n\n        to establish only that it had a \"good faith basis\" to believe that the prior bad act in\n\n        fact occurred: \"One is not required to assume or know in advance whether the\n\n        witness is aware of the prior bad act, there simply has to be a good faith basis for\n\n        asking about the act itself.\" VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 46-47.\n\n              The defense explained that it was particularly concerned about questioning\n\n        based on a \"treatmentjournal\" that Schierman had kept while he was a patient at the\n\n        Lakeside-Milam, a drug and alcohol addiction treatment facility. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1159846\"><a href=\"/opinion/1159846/state-v-bartholomew/\">Id. at 47</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

The State argues\n\n        that Schierman failed to preserve any such error because he did not cite Bartholomew\n\n        I and II or argue that the journal was more prejudicial than probative when\n\n        challenging its admission in the penalty phase proceeding.\n\n               The State is correct that Schierman neither cited Bartholomew I and II nor\n\n        objected to the journal's admission on the ground that the journal was irrelevant or\n\n        more prejudicial than probative. Instead, he sought to exclude the journal on the\n\n        ground that none of his mitigation witnesses had personal knowledge of the events\n\n\n\n                                                 153\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       (fictional or otherwise) recounted in the journal. Thus, defense counsel did not\n\n        preserve the errors that Schierman now raises.\n\n              Under RAP 2.5(a)(3), this court may decline review of an unpreserved error\n\n        unless the error is both \"manifest\" and \"truly of constitutional dimension.\" O'Hara,\n\n        \\61 Wn.2d at 98. We have said that an error is of constitutional magnitude only if\n\n        it deprives the defendant of an actual constitutional guaranty. Id. at 99, 103\n\n       (contrasting errors of constitutional magnitude, such as jury instructions that shift\n\n        the burden of proof, and errors of nonconstitutional magnitude, such as failure to\n\n        instruct on a lesser included offense). But the limitation on aggravating evidence in\n\n        a capital penalty phase proceeding was established by Bartholomew I and II and was\n\n        clearly based on our state constitution. Thus,the admission of aggravating evidence\n\n        in violation of Bartholomew I and II is an error of constitutional magnitude.^'^\n\n\n\n                To the extent that this holding conflicts with certain statements in Lord I, 117\n        Wn.2d at 895, we disavow Lord I. In that case, this court held that it would not consider\n        an unpreserved challenge to the admission of penalty phase testimony regarding the age of\n        a girl the defendant victimized in a prior offense. Id. It reasoned that the defendant\"does\n        not specify how the age of the victim especially prejudiced him and, thus, was\n        constitutional error.\" Id. (emphasis added). This misstates our precedent on RAP\n        2.5(a)(3). In equating \"prejudice\" with \"constitutional magnitude,\" the Lord I court\n        purported to rely on State v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1350721\"><a href=\"/opinion/1350721/state-v-scott/\">110 Wn.2d 682</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1350721\"><a href=\"/opinion/1350721/state-v-scott/\">757 P.2d 492</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(1988). 117 Wn.2d\n        at 895. But Scott does not equate those concepts—on the contrary, it defines errors of\n        \"constitutional magnitude\" just as they are defined in O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at 98-99: as\n        errors that deprive the defendant of a constitutional guaranty. See 110 Wn.2d at 689-91\n        (declining review under RAP 2.5 not because defendant failed to show prejudice, but\n        because alleged error did not violate constitutional guaranty).\n\n                                                   154\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Whether the admission of the treatment journal was \"manifest\" error under\n\n       RAP 2.5(a)(3) is a more difficult question. To prove that an unpreserved error is\n\n        manifest, an appellant must make a '\"plausible showing . . . that the asserted error\n\n        had practical and identifiable consequences in the trial.'\" Kalebaugh, 183 Wn.2d at\n\n        584 (quoting O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at 99). And a practical and identifiable error is\n\n        one that '\"the [trial] court could have corrected,'\" given what it knew at the time.\n\n       Id.(quoting O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at 100).\n\n              In this case, that standard is satisfied as to two of the alleged but unpreserved\n\n        errors regarding the treatment journal—^the ruling that the journal's references to\n\n        specific instances of conduct were relevant rebuttal evidence (under ER 402) and\n\n        the ruling that this evidence was more probative than prejudicial(ER 403). These\n\n        are legal questions, which we can resolve—and the trial court could have\n\n        addressed—by comparing the content of Dubinsky's testimony on direct\n\n        examination with the content of the treatment journal the State sought to use on\n\n        cross-examination. But that standard is not met with respect to the other error that\n\n        Schierman alleges—^the trial court's (implicit) determination that the treatment\n\n       journal was sufficiently reliable for the State to have a good faith basis to use it,\n\n        particularly in the penalty phase proceeding. Because the defense failed to challenge\n\n        the journal as unreliable (or otherwise insufficient to provide the State with a good\n\n        faith base for cross-examination), the record contains no colloquy on this issue.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       cannot now guess what that colloquy would have revealed if it had actually occurred.\n\n       Nor could the trial court have corrected a problem about which it was unaware. We\n\n       therefore address the merits of only the first two issues: relevance and probative\n\n        value versus prejudicial effect.\n\n                        2. We reject Schierman's claim that the specific instances of\n                           conduct described in the treatmentjournal were inadmissible\n              In Lord I, this court held that the scope ofrebuttal evidence in a penalty phase\n\n        proceeding was broad, but still limited by Bartholomew II's balancing of probative\n\n        value against prejudicial effect: \"defense witnesses may be cross-examined\n\n        concerning anything relevant to a matter raised in mitigation by the defendant,\n\n        subject to the balancing test.\" 117 Wn.2d at 889-93,892. The Lordl court explained\n\n        that Bartholomew II's rebuttal rule was \"analogous to the rules of evidence\n\n        concerning testimony about defendant's character\":\n\n                     When a defendant presents evidence of his character, the State\n               may inquire further to determine the reliability of that evidence.

The events described in Schierman's treatment\n\n       journal were no less well known to Dubinsky, who first read excerpts from the\n\n       journal the night before giving his mitigation testimony.\n\n              IV.

Facts\n\n\n              On redirect, defense counsel called Dubinsky's attention to a portion of the\n\n       treatment journal labeled page 3379, which was included among the photocopied\n\n       pages marked as State's exhibit 2, and asked if it \"look[ed] like addresses where\n\n       [Schierman was] maybe seeking jobs or doing something like that?\" VRP(Apr. 20,\n\n       2010) at 128. The State objected on grounds of foundation, and the court sustained\n\n       the objection.\n\n              Defense counsel stated that the State had already laid the foundation: \"[The\n\n        prosecutor] has shown you what has been marked as... State's exhibit number two.\"\n\n       Id. at 129. Counsel then asked Dubinsky to read from page 3379.

Analysis\n\n              Schierman argues that the defense \"had a right\" at trial \"to introduce more\n\n       positive aspects of [the treatment journal]\" after the State \"cherry pick[ed] those\n\n       [passages] where Schierman described anger or violence.\" Appellant's Opening Br.\n\n       at 168. The State counters that Schierman could have introduced the treatment\n\n\n       journal through other witnesses, but could not simply have Dubinsky \"read for the\n\n       jury portions of a document as to which he has no knowledge.\" Br. ofResp't at 226.\n\n             The State is correct. Dubinsky's testimony on direct examination included\n\n       evidence of Schierman's (the \"accused['s],\" per BR 404(a)(1)) character,\n\n       specifically his character trait of nonviolence while drunk. It was admissible under\n\n       Bartholomew II (even if it had not been admissible under the Rules of Evidence).\n\n       The State's inquiry into specific instances of Schierman's violence on cross-\n\n       examination was permissible to impeach Dubinsky's testimony that Schierman was\n\n       not violent when drinking—it tended both to rebut this testimony and call into\n\n       question Dubinsky's credibility. Thus, it was admissible under BR 405(a) and not\n\n        barred by Bartholomew II.

He testified that Schierman was friendly, well liked, and serious about his\n\n        addiction recovery. The court then permitted the State to cross examine O'Brien\n\n        about statements he made to detectives investigating the murders. The State asked\n\n        O'Brien whether he relayed incriminating statements that a third party, Mark Nanna,\n\n        made about Schierman. Schierman argues that this line of questioning violates the\n\n        constitutional rules adopted in Bartholomew I and II by introducing aggravating\n\n        evidence that was both irrelevant and hearsay.\n\n\n                  As the trial court suggested, the positive aspects of Schierman's life reflected in\n        the treatment journal might well have been admissible through other witnesses; they\n        constitute aspects of his character that might weigh in favor of a life sentence and might\n        even have been admissible under ER 106 to help complete the jury's understanding of the\n        joumal.

O'Brien testified that he\n\n        met Schierman in late 2000 and that the two became close friends. He testified that\n\n        their relationship became more distant when Schierman began using drugs, but\n\n        improved when Schierman completed treatment. He described Schierman as\n\n        friendly, well liked, and energetic, and stated that Schierman took his treatment and\n\n        recovery seriously and appeared to be doing well when O'Brien last saw him before\n\n        the murders. O'Brien also testified that he still tried to visit Schierman regularly and\n\n        that Schierman always appeared to be in good spirits and happy to see him.\n\n              On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked O'Brien about the arguably\n\n        contradictory statements he had made to detectives following the murders. These\n\n        statements related to Schierman's drinking, the strain it had put on their friendship,\n\n        and Schierman's tendency to be friendly and flirtatious when he drank, but they did\n\n        not touch directly on Schierman's general friendliness, energy, or treatment\n\n        progress.

The motion\n\n        included a transcript of the defense interview of the detective who interviewed\n\n        Nanna about the statements.

The State argued\n\n        that it had a good faith basis for asking O'Brien about Nanna's alleged statements,\n\n        because it had determined that Nanna was trying to protect Schierman (and that his\n\n        statements to detectives could therefore not be trusted).

It reasoned that the State's \"extensive questioning\n\n        was required because clearly Mr. O'Brien was attempting to deny or minimize the\n\n        information he had earlier provided to detective[s] . . . and when finally confronted\n\n        with that follow-up report,...

The defense ultimately did not call that detective.\n\n                       B. Analysis\n\n              Schierman argues that O'Brien's statements to the police \"had no rebuttal\n\n        value\" because they did not contradict anything O'Brien said on direct examination:\n\n       \"the court suggested that the prosecutor's rebuttal was appropriate because O'Brien\n\n        was reluctant to acknowledge his role in the investigation. But that reasoning is\n\n        circular: it assumes that the prosecutor had a good reason in the first place for\n\n        questioning O'Brien about his dealings with the police.\" Appellant's Opening Br.\n\n        at 177, 180.\n\n              This argument goes much farther than any made in the trial court. At trial,\n\n        defense counsel did not object that O'Brien's contacts with police were irrelevant.\n\n                                                166\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       Instead, defense counsel objected only to the portion of that questioning in which\n\n       the prosecutor actually read from the investigating officers' notes—^the portion that\n\n        quoted the statements attributed to Narma—and did so only on the basis that these\n\n        statements were hearsay. For this reason, we must consider whether to review\n\n        Schierman's unpreserved claim that O'Brien's contacts with police were irrelevant.\n\n              Schierman also argues, as did defense counsel in the trial court, that the\n\n        statements attributed to Nanna were inadmissible hearsay.\n\n              Because we reach the merits of Schierman's first argument—^that O'Brien's\n\n        decision to contact police was not relevant to rebut O'Brien's mitigation\n\n        testimony—and because we agree with Schierman on this issue, we do not decide\n\n        whether Nanna's statements were inadmissible hearsay.\n\n                        1. Relevance ofO'Brien 's decision to contactpolice\n\n                           a. Preservation of error\n\n              The prosecutor began his cross-examination by asking O'Brien whether he\n\n        remembered calling a detective at the Kirkland Police Station and \"telling him that\n\n        you needed to get something off your chest?\" VRP(Apr. 21, 2010)at 82. This line\n\n        of questioning implies the following evidentiary rule: when a witness offers\n\n        mitigating character testimony in a capital sentencing proceeding, that witness's\n\n        decision to furnish the police with information tending to show the defendant's guilt\n\n        is inherently relevant in rebuttal. Defense counsel did not challenge that assumption\n\n                                                167\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No, 84614-6\n\n\n        in the trial court, but Schierman does now.         He argues that it violates the\n\n        constitutional rules adopted in Bartholomew I and II and Lord 1.\n\n              An appellate court may decline to review an unpreserved error unless the error\n\n        is both \"manifest\" and \"truly of constitutional dimension.\" O'Hara, 167 Wn.2d at\n\n        98. But the erroneous admission of aggravating penalty phase evidence is always of\n\n       \"constitutional dimension\" if the claim is that it violates Bartholomew I and II. Id.\n\n        We also conclude that relevance of O'Brien's decision to contact police is a question\n\n        of law that the trial court could have addressed on the record before it at the time of\n\n        trial without need for any other evidence, testimony, or other information. We\n\n        therefore reach the merits of Schierman's claim that O'Brien's decision to contact\n\n        police was not relevant rebuttal evidence.\n\n                            b. Merits\n\n              The question presented is whether a capital penalty phase mitigation witness'\n\n        decision to provide the police with incriminating information about the defendant\n\n        rebuts that witness' testimony on the topic of the defendant's friendliness, energy,\n\n        and treatment progress. Our only cases on the scope of mitigation witness cross-\n\n        examination are Lord I and Brett.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84|514-6\n\n\n              In Lord I, this court analogized Bartholomew I and IPs limits on mitigation-\n\n        rebuttal to \"the rules ofevidence concerning testimony about defendant's character.\"\n\n        117 Wn.2d at 891-92 (quoting ER 405(a)). Ultimately, Lord I held that testimony\n\n        that the defendant\"fled from police and violated his probation\" was relevant to rebut\n\n        his father's testimony that he was \"a 'good boy'.\" Id. at 893-94. In Brett, the\n\n        prosecution cross-examined mitigation witnesses about the defendant's juvenile\n\n        crimes,including first degree kidnapping and assault. 126 Wn.2d at 187. This court\n\n        approved the cross-examination as \"relevant to rebut . . . mitigation witness[]\n\n        testimony that [the defendant] was not a threatening person and/or that it was\n\n        surprising that he took a person's life.\" Id. at 188. It also held that evidence of prior\n\n        uncharged crimes was relevant to rebut another mitigation witness's testimony that\n\n        the defendant \"'respected people'\" and was \"'a real gentleman'.\" Id.\n\n              This case is distinguishable from Lord I and Brett in that O'Brien did not claim\n\n        that Schierman was a good or trustworthy person. Instead, he claimed only that\n\n        Schierman was well liked, took his addiction treatment seriously, and maintained a\n\n        friendship with O'Brien even after his incarceration. For this reason, questioning\n\n        O'Brien about his decision to contact the police was outside the scope ofpermissible\n\n        cross-examination under Lord I and Brett (applying BR 404 and 405). O'Brien's\n\n        decision to contact police—arguably showing his suspicions about Schierman's\n\n        guilt—does not rebut his testimony that Schierman was well liked, took treatment\n                                                  169\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Thus, in this case,\n\n        we must evaluate the prosecutor's reference to the Holocaust and September 11 in\n\n        light of the prosecutor's \"total argument, the issues in the case, the evidence\n\n        addressed in the argument,and the instructions given to the jury,\" Brown,132 Wn.2d\n\n        at 561, paying special attention to whether that argument appealed to the \"passion\n\n        or prejudice ofthe jury,\" Id. at 564.\n\n               We hold that, in the context of the prosecutor's total argument, the reference\n\n        to September 11 is not an attempt to analogize Schierman to a political terrorist or\n\n        the murders of the Milkin family to the civilian deaths on September 11, 2001.\n\n        Rather, it seems that the prosecutor invoked September 11 as part of a meditation on\n\n        the meaning ofthe word \"terror.\" VRP(May 3, 2010)at 67-69. He argued that that\n\n        word is used \"almost too casual[ly]\" today, and invited the jury to imagine the \"real\n\n        terror\" that the Milkin family must have felt when they were attacked. Id. at 69. The\n\n        circumstances of the defendant's crime are relevant to the jury's decision at the\n\n        penalty phase in a capital case—indeed, the jury is required to consider them.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        110 Wn.2d at 606-08. The prosecutor's reference to September 11 was a segue into\n\n       his description of the victims' suffering. It was not misconduct.\n\n              The Holocaust reference is different. The prosecutor did not just analogize\n\n       the murders ofthe Milkin family to the Nazi murders ofthe victims ofthe Holocaust.\n\n        Instead, the prosecutor quoted from a Holocaust museum plaque about the\n\n        immorality of remaining a \"bystander.\" VRP(May 3, 2010) at 74. The message to\n\n        the jurors was that they had a moral duty to take meaningful affirmative action in\n\n        response to Schierman's holocaust, or else they would suffer the same moral guilt\n\n        as those who stood silent and thereby effectively collaborated during the Nazi\n\n        Holocaust.

Statutory Review\n\n               Washington's death penalty statute requires this court to consider four\n\n        questions when reviewing a sentence of death:\n\n                  (a)Whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the affirmative\n               finding to the question posted by RCW 10.95.060(4);'^^'^^ and\n                  (b)Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to\n               the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and\n               the defendant...;[and]\n                  (c)Whether the sentence of death was brought about through\n               passion or prejudice; and\n                  (d)Whether the defendant had an intellectual disability within the\n               meaning of RCW 10.95.030(2).\n\n        RCW 10.95.130(2).\n\n               Schierman does not argue that the evidence was insufficient to support the\n\n        jury's finding under RCW 10.95.060(4) or that he has an \"intellectual disability\"\n\n        within the meaning of RCW 10.95.030(2)(d). He does argue that his sentence was\n\n        disproportionate and that it resulted from passion or prejudice.\n\n               Schierman contends that his death sentence is disproportionate because the\n\n        death penalty is meted out randomly in Washington, where, for example, Gary\n\n        Ridgway was convicted of killing 48 people but received only a life sentence while\n\n        Schierman, who killed far fewer people, was sentenced to death. He acknowledges\n\n\n\n                  Under RCW 10.95.060(4), the jury must \"retire to deliberate upon the following\n        question:'Having in mind the crime of which the defendant has been found guilty, are you\n        convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances\n        to merit leniency?'\"\n                                                   183\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

Georgia^^\n\n              Washington's death penalty statute requires this court to determine \"[wjhether\n\n        the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in\n\n        similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\"                    RCW\n\n        10.95.130(2)(b).'''' If the court answers yes to that question, the sentence must be\n\n        invalidated. RCW 10.95.140(l)(b). When this court conducts a proportionality\n\n        review, it considers the penalties imposed in all cases of aggravated first degree\n\n        murder, regardless of whether the prosecutor pursued the death penalty or whether\n\n        the fact-finder ultimately imposed it. This court has described this review as\n\n        comparing the case at bar to all \"death eligible cases.\" Cross, 156 Wn.2d at 630.\n\n\n\n\n             \"</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\">408 U.S. 238</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\">92 S.

After\n\n        evaluating Rupe's crime in tenns ofaggravating circumstances,the court considered\n\n        Rupe's personal characteristics.

This weighed heavily in the\n\n        court's analysis since the court had upheld Rupe's death sentence largely on the basis\n\n        of aggravating factors. Id. at 626. The court also observed that \"Rice's crime is ...\n\n        similar in nature to those committed in two other cases recently before this court in\n\n        which we affirmed death sentences.\" Id. By \"similar in nature,\" the court appeared\n\n        to refer to the fact that, like Rice, the defendants in these cases killed at least one\n\n        victim in order to cover up other murders. Id. As in Rupe,the court noted that Rice's\n\n        personal characteristics were primarily mitigating: Rice had mental illness and no\n\n        criminal history. Id. at 626-27.

Justice Utter wrote a dissent championing the\n\n        kind of statistical analysis exemplified by the Rupe court's treatment of aggravating\n\n        circumstances. Lord I, 117 Wn.2d at 939-45. Justice Utter argued that a death\n\n       \"sentence is excessive and disproportionate if it has not 'generally been imposed in\n\n        similar cases,\"' and maintained that \"[a] sentence is not 'generally' imposed unless\n\n        it is imposed in at least 50 percent ofthe similar cases.\" Id.\n\n              The Lord I majority rejected that analysis, reasoning that disproportionality\n\n        review is not concerned \"with . . . [tjechnical inconsistencies in a line-by-line\n\n        comparison :\n\n\n              Indeed, the jury is directed to tailor its decision to the individual\n              circumstances of the crime. A jury could decline to impose the death\n              penalty because a particular defendant deserves mercy. However, the\n              decision to afford one defendant mercy, and yet not another, does not\n              violate the constitution.\n\n\n        117 Wn.2dat910.\n\n\n              Because one can never predict when a jury will show mercy, the Lord I\n\n        majority concluded that \"[rjequiring precise unifonnity [of punishment] . . . would\n\n        effectively eliminate the death penalty.\" Id. The majority then went on to apply a\n\n        proportionality analysis that can best be summarized as follows: a death sentence is\n                                                 189\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n         State V.

M at 911-14.\n\n\n               After Lord I, this court sometimes reiterated Harris'^ \"generally\" standard in\n\n        its proportionality review.^^ More often and more recently, however, it has omitted\n\n        any reference to that standard, stating instead that the purpose of proportionality\n\n        review is to prevent only the \"wanton and freakish\" imposition ofa death sentence.^^\n\n                     C.

Our proportionality review has become so deferential that it fails to\n                       serve the protective purpose the legislature intended\n\n              While this court's decisions have varied in their approach to proportionality\n\n       review, a few consistent holdings have emerged. Each of them helps to illustrate\n\n        why this court is unlikely ever to find a death sentence disproportionate—and,hence,\n\n        why the proportionality review statute is being improperly construed in favor ofthe\n\n        State rather than in favor ofthe defendant.\n\n              First, if the defendant shows cruelty to his victims (the nature of the crime), a\n\n        death sentence is proportionate even if no other comparability factor weighs in favor\n\n        of that finding. Cross, 156 Wn.2d at 631-34(death sentence proportionate where at\n\n        least one victim consciously suffered, aggravating circumstances weighed neither\n\n        for nor against a finding of proportionality, the defendant lacked a significant\n\n        criminal history, and the defendant's personal history \"contain[ed] elements that\n\n        both tend to support the jury's verdict and argue in favor of mercy\").\n\n              Second, a death sentence is not disproportionate simply because it is imposed\n\n        on a defendant with serious mental illness and no significant criminal history.

Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n        without parole. Id. at 377-86. The Davis II majority affirmed the death sentence\n\n        because it found plausible explanations for several ofthese sentences—explanations\n\n        like the defendant's youth or diminished capacity, the prosecution's lack of direct\n\n        evidence, the presence of a single juror who was adamantly opposed to the death\n\n        penalty, or the prosecutor's disqualification for an overlooked conflict. Id. at 357-\n\n       60. But, as the dissent noted, this ignored RCW 10.95.130(2)(b)'s requirement that\n\n        we affirm a death sentence only if that sentence is generally \"imposed in similar\n\n        cases :\n\n\n\n                     The majority suggests that our death penalty system is\n              proportional because death and life sentences can be explained by\n              factors beyond the crime and the defendant, such as the strength of the\n              State's case, the wishes of the victim's family, or facts known to the\n              defendant about other, unsolved cases. In concluding that these factors\n              make the death penalty proportional, the majority again ignores the\n              language of RCW 10.95.130(2)(b), mistaking the question of whether\n              a sentence is appropriate in an individual case for whether the sentence\n              is generally imposed in similar cases. But the statute requires us to\n              analyze the death penalty, a punishment unique in its severity and\n              irrevocability, on a system-wide level.\n\n                     When one takes the broad, statutorily directed perspective,\n              factors that appear rational at an individual level become irrational. ..\n              . [Wjhen viewed as part of a system of deciding who dies and who\n              lives, these same factors create irrational, perverse results. A murderer\n              is more likely to escape death if he has concealed the details of an\n              unsolved crime or fortuitously picked a victim whose family opposes\n              the death penalty.\n\n       Id. at 387(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                                198\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n              Schierman argues that a majority ofthis court should adopt the \"well-reasoned\n\n       dissents\" in Davis II and Cross. Appellant's Opening Br. at 201. I agree. This\n\n       court's approach to proportionality review no longer comports with our legislature's\n\n       protective intent in enacting ROW 10.95.130(2)(b).\n\n              The history of proportionality review demonstrates that we have no single\n\n       clear interpretation of ROW 10.95.130(2)(b). Instead, for the past 35 years we have\n\n        applied continually shifting interpretations—interpretations that allowed us to keep\n\n        affirming death sentences even as they grew more and more statistically rare. When\n\n        questions arose about the proper interpretation ofthe proportionality review statute,\n\n        we consistently resolved those questions in favor ofthe State. See Cross, 156 Wn.2d\n\n        at 636-37 (acknowledging uncertainty over whether the legislature intended this\n\n        court to include in the comparison database death penalty sentences later reversed,\n\n        but resolving that \"doubt\" adversely to the defendant); Lord I, 117 Wn.2d at 909-10\n\n       (acknowledging that RCW 10.95.130(2)(b)\"'provides little guidance to determine\n\n        at what point a death sentence becomes . . . disproportionate,\"' but rejecting Justice\n\n        fitter's standard because \"it would effectively eliminate the death penalty\"(quoting\n\n        Harris, 106 Wn.2d at 798)).\n\n              In the end, given how rarely death sentences were actually sought or imposed\n\n        in these cases, we could find those sentences proportionate only by ignoring most or\n\n        all of the comparability factors in our analysis. E.g., Davis II, 175 Wn.2d at 354-55\n                                                 199\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V. Schierman (Conner), No. 84614-6\n\n\n       (finding death sentence proportionate even though, with respect to every\n\n       comparability factor, the number of life sentences imposed vastly exceeded the\n\n       number of death sentences imposed); Cross, 156 Wn.2d at 631-34 (affirming death\n\n       sentence even though (1)\"the death penalty has not been sought in cases at least as\n\n       brutal,\" (2) the single aggravating circumstance of multiple victims as part of a\n\n       common scheme or plan does not weigh either for or against finding of\n\n       proportionality, (3) the defendant had minimal criminal history, and (4) the\n\n       defendant suffered childhood abuse and had diagnosed personality disorders). And\n\n       that is exactly what we would need to do again, to affirm the death penalty in this\n\n       case since, for purposes of the proportionality analysis, Schierman's case is similar\n\n       to Cross\n\n\n             I agree with Schierman that this precedent is incon-ect: it fails to fulfill ROW\n\n       10.95.130(2)(b)'s prophylactic purpose and it interprets an ambiguous penal statute\n\n       in favor of the State, rather than the defendant. I also agree that it is harmful: it\n\n       results in the disproportionate imposition of the death penalty. I would therefore\n\n       hold for the reasons articulated in the dissents to Davis II and Cross that imposing\n\n\n\n                There was evidenee of victim suffering (marked cruelty), the jury found the same\n       single aggravating eireumstanee (multiple victims as part of a common scheme or plan),\n       the defendant had minimal criminal history (in Schierman's case, no criminal history), and\n       the defendant offered evidence of childhood abuse as a mitigating factor at the penalty\n       phase.\n\n                                                 200\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n        State V.

It may be difficult to imagine a case\n\n        in which a death sentence would survive a properly conducted proportionality\n\n        review, but that hypothetical question is not before us. Nor is the constitutionality\n\n        of the death penalty, which Schierman has not separately briefed.

A majority of this\n\n        court, in separate opinions, also declines to reverse Schierman's sentences of death.\n\n        I would reverse his death sentences due to errors in the exclusion of mitigating\n\n        evidence and also because that penalty is impermissibly disproportionate under\n\n        RCW 10.95.130(2)(b).

The trial court therefore did\n\n        not err in excluding Dr. McClung's testimony due to its inadequate foundation.\n\n               3.      Statutory capital sentence review\n\n               Because the trial court did not err in its evidentiary rulings, Schierman's\n\n       sentence should be affirmed if it passes a statutory capital sentence review, which\n\n        requires the court to address four issues:\n\n                      (a) Whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the\n               affirmative finding to the question posed by ROW 10.95.060(4);^^^ and\n\n                    (b) Whether the sentence of death is excessive or\n              disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering\n              both the crime and the defendant. For the purposes of this subsection,\n              \"similar cases\" means cases reported in the Washington Reports or\n              Washington Appellate Reports since January 1, 1965, in which the\n              judge or jury considered the imposition of capital punishment\n              regardless of whether it was imposed or executed, and cases in which\n              reports have been filed with the supreme court under RCW 10.95.120;\n\n\n               ^ It only \"might\" be properly considered because Dr. McClung was also unable to reach\n        any conclusion about whether any prior head injuries Schierman may have suffered actually had\n        any impact on his behavior or mental processes. See CP at 8259-60.\n               ^ RCW 10.95.060(4) provides,\"Upon conclusion of the evidence and argument at the\n       special sentencing proceeding, the jury shall retire to deliberate upon the following question:\n       'Having in mind the crime of which the defendant has been found guilty, are you convinced\n       beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit\n        leniency?'\"\n\n\n                                                        19\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

As correctly noted by the lead opinion, the arguments in this\n\n       case focus on the second and third issues, which are whether Schierman's sentence\n\n        is disproportionate or was brought about through passion and prejudice. Lead\n\n        opinion at 182.\n\n               Schierman does little to highlight specific facts about himself, his crimes, or\n\n        comparable cases indicating that \"the sentence of death is excessive or\n\n        disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the\n\n        crime and the defendant.\" RCW 10.95.130(2)(b). Instead, he argues, and the lead\n\n        opinion agrees, that \"Washington's death penalty is imposed in a wanton and\n\n       freakish manner,\" such that every capital sentence in Washington should be found\n\n        statutorily disproportionate. Appellant's Opening Br. at 198; see lead opinion at\n\n        181-200.

At a time when\n\n        he knew that Olga Milkin's husband was deployed overseas, Schierman entered\n\n        her home and killed her along with her two sons, who were three and five years\n\n        old, and her sister, who was a college student. Olga Milkin and her sister were\n\n        stripped oftheir clothing and stabbed repeatedly in the head and neck. Both were\n\n        stabbed in the neck from the front with such force that the knife actually damaged\n\n\n                This court has shown it is firmly committed to carefully considering new information\n       regarding the constitutionality of capital punishment. See Order, State v. Gregory, No. 88086-7\n       (Wash. Nov. 21,2017). That issue is simply not presented here. Schierman does not provide any\n       new information or any new arguments, and the relevant portions of his briefing do not engage in any\n       meaningful analysis of any constitutional provisions. See Appellant's Opening Br. at 197-202;\n        Appellant's Reply Br. at 72-75.\n                '' Schierman is white, and there is no indication that race or any other suspect\n        classification was implicated at any point in these proceedings.\n\n                                                        21\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n       State V.

One of the\n\n        children was stabbed through the throat from one side to the other, and the other\n\n        child's throat was cut so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. When Schierman\n\n        woke up in the Milkins' home and found himself covered in blood with four dead\n\n        bodies, he took a shower, changed his clothes, and attempted to bum the house\n\n        down in order to destroy the evidence. The nature ofthese crimes is at least as\n\n        brutal as others in which we have upheld a capital sentence. See id. at 349-51.\n\n               The only aggravating factor submitted to the jury was that \"[tjhere was more\n\n       than one victim and the murders were part of a common scheme or plan.\" RCW\n\n        10.95.020(10).

As applied to\n\n       the particular facts presented, the nature ofthis aggravating circumstance goes\n\n        beyond the minimal statutory requirements—Schierman's crimes ended the lives\n\n        of a young mother and her two small children while their father was deployed\n\n        overseas, as well as the children's aunt who was there to help while their father\n\n        was gone. He literally destroyed the Milkin family and their home.\n\n               Schierman's lack of prior convictions and difficult personal history neither\n\n        require nor prevent a finding of disproportionality.

The apparent\n\n        distinction is that a prejudice analysis considers the defendant's ultimate guilt or\n\n        innocence, while a triviality analysis considers only whether the defendant was\n\n        deprived of the protections conferred by the public trial right. Concurrence at 3-5.\n\n        This distinction is semantic at best. While it is true that the triviality doctrine does\n\n        not invoke that aspect of harmless error review that considers trial error harmless in\n\n        the face of overwhelming untainted evidence of guilt, that is not the sum total of\n\n        harmlessness review. Fully understood, such review necessarily asks whether the\n\n        defendant suffered a cognizable harm from deprivation ofthe constitutional right at\n\n        issue. As one commentator has aptly observed, requiring defendants to demonstrate\n\n        that a closure tangibly subverted the-core values of the public trial right amounts to\n\n        a harmless error review that is inconsistent with controlling Sixth Amendment\n\n        precedent:\n\n                      The triviality doctrine also approaches harmless error analysis,\n               requiring more of defendants than Waller and Presley allow. . . .

A\n               defendant in a triviality jurisdiction does not have to show a reasonable\n               possibility that the outcome of the trial would have been different (i.e.,\n               prejudice), but he does have to show some kind ofspecific injury manifested\n\n\n                                                     -7-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

See In re Pers. Restraint ofOrange, 152 Wn.2d795,100P.3d\n        291 (2004). It is therefore ironic that the court in Gibbons relied on this separate closure\n        (which it ex ante deemedjustified) as the reason nothing significant took place in the closed\n        courtroom.\n\n\n\n                                                     -9-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

That a bare majority ofthis court\n\n        now prefers the triviality standard we have, time and again, rejected, is not a\n\n        sufficient basis to adopt that standard today. Not only is a course change\n\n        unwarranted, but as explained below, it is also unwise.\n\n           II.

In sum, the\n\n        triviality doctrine operates as an ad hoc, post hoc, sniff test.

See concurrence at 5 n.2\n\n        (stating the inverse proposition: \"The Supreme Court ofthe United States has never\n\n        rejected the possibility of a de minimis closure\"). The recent decision in Weaver,\n\n        which recognized the petitioner must show prejudice to establish an ineffective\n\n        assistance of counsel claim in a collateral attack on a conviction, does not\n\n        foreshadow the Supreme Court's eventual adoption of a triviality test. While the\n\n        court there rejected the argument that an unjustified closure necessarily renders a\n\n        trial \"fundamentally unfair,\" this was in the context of rejecting an automatic\n\n        prejudice rule for purposes of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See\n\n        Weaver, 137 S. Ct. at 1911. The court in Weaver adhered to its precedents in Waller\n\n        and Presley, reaffirming that although courtroom closures may be justified in some\n\n        circumstances, it is \"'still incumbent upon' the trial court 'to consider all reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -16-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

As noted, critics have recognized the obvious tension between\n\n        adherence to the Waller test and application ofa triviality analysis, in that the former\n\n        requires a preclosure examination ofjustified reasons to close a proceeding, while\n\n        the latter eschews this requirement to excuse a closure after the fact.\n\n               Furthermore, application of a triviality test is inconsistent with United States\n\n        Supreme Court precedent that refuses to reduce specific Sixth Amendment\n\n        protections to a generalized \"fairness\" inquiry; the Court has warned that this\n\n        approach\n\n               in effect reads the Sixth Amendment as a more detailed version of the Due\n               Process Clause—and then proceeds to give no effect to the details.

Schierman (Conner Michael), No. 84614-6\n        (Stephens, J., dissenting in part, concurring in part)\n\n\n\n        the rigid structural error rule. What it fails to appreciate, however, is that the\n\n        structural error analysis compelled under the Sixth Amendment by Waller, and under\n\n        article I, section 22 of our state constitution by Bone-Club, is not a rigid rule. As\n\n        explained below, these cases fully allow courts to meaningfully assess when it is\n\n        possible to close proceedings consistent with the constitutional guaranty of a public\n\n        trial. But, unlike the triviality doctrine, they provide a principled analysis that\n\n        safeguards the public trial right.\n\n           III. The Weil-Established Standards for Evaluating Closures under Waller and\n                Bone-Club Provide the Flexibility Courts Need without Diminishing the\n                Public Trial Right\n\n               The majority's motivation for embracing the triviality standard appears to be\n\n        a desire to avoid a rigid, inflexible rule of automatic reversal in the face of\n\n        inconsequential closures. There is no such rule. Behind the seemingly draconian\n\n        label of \"structural error\" is the real public trial doctrine that has developed since\n\n        Waller. This doctrine is flexible and takes into account the competing values that\n\n        face a trial court in deciding whether to close a particular proceeding.\n\n               Waller and Bone-Club recognize that the defendant's right to a public trial is\n\n        not absolute but may give way to other values, including the right to a fair trial or\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -18-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.

The majority's adoption ofan ex ante triviality standard only\n\n        muddies the waters by suggesting to trial courts that in addition to engaging in a\n\n        Bone-Club analysis, they should consider whether an appellate court will deem a\n\n        closure made without such analysis too trivial to warrant reversal in any event. Such\n\n        a message to the trial bench is entirely unhelpful at this juncture in our public trial\n\n\n\n                                                    -19-\n\fFor the current opinion, go to https://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/wareports/.\n\n        State V.
